\olsection{Some Important Sets}

\begin{ex}
Mostly we'll be dealing with sets that have mathematical objects as
members. You will remember the various sets of numbers: $\Nat$
is the set of \emph{natural} numbers $\{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$;
$\Int$ the set of \emph{integers} $\{\dots, -3, -2,
-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$; $\Rat$ the set of
\emph{rationals} ($\Rat = \Setabs{z/n}{z \in \Int, n \in \Nat, n \neq 0}$); and
$\Real$ the set of \emph{real} numbers. These are all \emph{infinite}
sets, that is, they each have infinitely many !!{element}s. As it turns
out, $\Nat$, $\Int$, $\Rat$ have the same number
of !!{element}s, while $\Real$ has a whole bunch more---$\Nat$,
$\Int$, $\Rat$ are ``!!{enumerable} and infinite'' whereas
$\Real$ is ``!!{nonenumerable}''.

We'll sometimes also use the set of positive integers $\Int^+ = \{1,
2, 3, \dots\}$ and the set containing just the first two natural
numbers $\Bin = \{0, 1\}$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[Strings]
Another interesting example  is the set $A^{*}$ of
\emph{finite strings} over an alphabet $A$: any finite sequence of elements of
$A$ is a string over $A$. We include the \emph{empty string $\Lambda$}
among the strings over $A$, for every alphabet~$A$. For instance,
\[
\Bin^*
=\{\Lambda,0,1,00,01,10,11,000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111,0000,\ldots\}.
\]
If $x=x_{1}\ldots x_{n}\in A^{*}$is a string consisting of $n$
``letters'' from $A$, then we say \emph{length} of the string is~$n$
and write $\len{x}=n$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[Infinite sequences]
For any set $A$ we may also consider the set~$A^\omega$ of infinite
sequences of !!{element}s of~$A$. An infinite sequence
$a_1a_2a_3a_4\dots$ consists of a one-way infinite list of objects,
each one of which is !!a{element} of~$A$.
\end{ex}
