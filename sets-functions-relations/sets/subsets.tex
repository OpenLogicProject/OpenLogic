\section{Subsets}

\begin{wordy}
Sets are made up of their elements, and every element of a set is a
part of that set.  But there is also a sense that some of the elements
of a set \emph{taken together} are a ``part of'' that set. For
instance, the number~$2$ is part of the set of integers, but the set
of even numbers is also apart of the set of integers. It's important
to keep those two senses of being part of a set separate.
\end{wordy}

\begin{defn}
If every element of a set $X$ is also an element of
    $Y$, then we say that $X$ is a \emph{subset} of $Y$, and write $X
    \subseteq Y$.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
First of all, every set is a subset of itself, and $\emptyset$ is a
subset of every set. The set of even number is a subset of the set of
natural numbers.  Also, $\{ a, b \} \subseteq \{ a, b, c \}$.

But $\{ a, b, e \}$ is not a subset of $\{ a, b, c \}$.
\end{ex}

\begin{wordy}
Note that a set may contain other sets!  
\end{wordy}


\begin{defn}
The set consisting of all subsetsof a set~$X$ is called the
\emph{power set of}~$X$, written $\Pow{X}$.
    \[\Pow{X} = \Setabs{x}{x \subseteq X} \]
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
What are all the possible subsets of $\{ a, b, c \}$? They are:
$\emptyset, \{a \}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a, b\}, \{a, c\}, \{a, c\}, \{a,
b, c\}$.  The set of all these subsets is $\Pow{\{a,b,c\}}$:
\[
\Pow{\{ a, b, c \}} = \{\emptyset, \{a \}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a, b\},
\{a, c\}, \{a, c\}, \{a, b, c\}\}
\]
\end{ex}
