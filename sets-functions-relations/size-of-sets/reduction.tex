\olsection{Reduction}

We showed $\Pow{\Int^+}$ to be !!{nonenumerable} by a diagonalization
argument. However, with the proof of the non-enumerability of
$\Bin^\omega$, the set of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s, in
place, we could have instead showed $\Pow{\Int^+}$ to be
!!{nonenumerable} by showing that \emph{if $\Pow{\Int^+}$ is
  enumerable then $\Bin^\omega$ is also enumerable}. This called
\emph{reducing} one problem to another.

\begin{proof}[Proof of {\olref[nen]{thm-nonenum-pownat}} by reduction]
Suppose, for reductio, $\Pow{\Int^+}$ is enumerable, and thus that
there is an enumeration of it $Z_{1}$, $Z_{2}$, $Z_{3}$, \dots

Define the function $f \colon \Pow{\Int^+} \to \Bin^\omega$ by letting
$f(Z)$ be the sequence $s_{k}$ such that $s_{k}(j) = 1$ iff $j \in Z$.

Every sequence of 0s and 1s corresponds to some set of positive
integers, namely the one which has as its members those integers
corresponding to the places where the the sequence has 1s. In other
words, this is !!a{surjective} function.

Now consider the list 
\[
f(Z_1), f(Z_2), f(Z_3), \dots
\]
Since $f$ is !!{surjective}, every member of $\Bin^\omega$ must
appear as a value of~$f$ for some argument, and so must appear on the
list. So this list must enumerate~$\Bin^\omega$.

So if $\Pow{\Int^+}$ were !!{enumerable}, $\Bin^\omega$ would be enumerable.
But $\Bin^\omega$ is !!{nonenumerable} (\olref[nen]{thm-nonenum-bin-omega}).
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
Show that the set of all sets of pairs of positive integers is
!!{nonenumerable}.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Show that $\Nat^\omega$, the set of infinite sequences of
natural numbers, is !!{nonenumerable}.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Let $P$ be the set of total functions from the set of positive
integers to the set $\{0\}$, and let $Q$ be the set of partial
functions from the set of positive integers to the set $\{0\}$. Show
that $P$ is !!{enumerable} and $Q$ is not.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Let $S$ be the set of all total !!{surjective} functions from the set
of positive integers to the set \{0,1\}. Show that $S$ is
!!{nonenumerable}.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Show that the set~$\Real$ of all real numbers is !!{nonenumerable}.
\end{prob}
