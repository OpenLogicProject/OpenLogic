  <h1>Open Logic Project Builds</h1>

  <p>This site contains PDFs built from
  the <a href="https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic">source
  LaTeX files</a> of the most recent version of
  the <a href="http://openlogicproject.org/">Open Logic
  Text</a>.</p>

  <h2>Complete PDFs</h2>

  <p>We have PDFs of the complete text in the Open Logic
  <code>master</code> branch, arranged in a somewhat sensible
  manner, including editorial comments. It's not intended as a
  textbook, but it shows what's there.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="open-logic-complete.pdf">Open Logic Text, Complete
	Clean Version</a>: one big PDF of all the material, without
	extra markup.</li>
    <li><a href="open-logic-debug.pdf">Open Logic Text, Complete Debug
	Version</a>: one big PDF with additional markup to identify
	source files and OLT-specific commands.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Individual Textbooks</h2>

  <p>There are already a few textbooks that show how one might "remix"
  the material in the Open Logic Project to produce nice
  textbooks. These vary in the material that's included, the design,
  and the configuration options used. They may also include additional
  material specific to those courses.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://slc.openlogicproject.org/"><em>Sets, Logic, Computation</em></a></h3>

  /></a>A textbook on metalogic, developed for Calgary's
  Logic II course: includes the material on set theory, first-order
  logic (including both sequent calculus and natural deduction), and
  Turing machines (including undecidability). Appendices cover proofs

  includes chapter summaries and a glossary. Problems are collected at
  the end of chapters.</p>

    <h3><a href="courses/set-theory/"><em>Set Theory: An Open Introduction</em></a></h3>
    
    <p><a href="courses/set-theory/"><img
    src="courses/set-theory/settheory.png" /></a>A brief introduction
    to the
    philosophy of set theory; covers why set theory came about;
      how to reduce large swathes of mathematics to set theory + arithmetic;
      how to embed arithmetic in set theory;
      what the cumulative iterative conception of set amounts to;
      how one might try to justify the axioms of ZFC. Most of the material making up the text comes from Tim Button's <i>Open Set Theory</i>.</p>

  the OLP material on propositional classical, many-valued, modal
  (including epistemic, temporal, and conditional logics), and
  intuitionistic logics. Appendices cover sets and relations, as well

<h3>Sample Texts</h3>

  <p>The OLP main repository also includes two sample textbooks that
  serve just to illustrate how one might produce texts using different
  formatting conventions.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="courses/enderton/open-logic-enderton.pdf">open-logic-enderton</a>,
    a sample textbook that follows the conventions of Enderton's
    popular <em>A Mathematical Introduction to Logic</em>.</li>
    <li><a href="courses/sample/open-logic-sample.pdf">open-logic-sample</a>,
    a selection including set theory, first-order logic, Turing
    machines, and incompleteness, using yet other conventions.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Active Branches</h2>

  <p>At any point, there may be active branches of the Open Logic
  Project in GitHub. This branches may contain additional material, or
  revisions of the material in the <code>master</code> branch which
  are being worked on or reviewed for inclusion. We provide PDFs of
    the complete text as it looks in these branches.</p>
