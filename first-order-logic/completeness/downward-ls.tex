\olsection{The L\"owenheim-Skolem Theorem}

\begin{thm} 
\ollabel{downward-ls} If $\Gamma$ is consistent then it has
!!a{denumerable} model, i.e., it is satisfiable in a !!{structure}
whose domain is either finite or infinite but !!{enumerable}.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
If $\Gamma$ is consistent, the !!{structure} $\Struct M$ delivered by
the proof of the completeness theorem has a domain $\Domain{M}$ whose
cardinality is bounded by that of the set of the terms of the language
$\Lang L$. So $\Struct M$ is at most !!{denumerable}.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm} 
\ollabel{noidentity-ls} If $\Gamma$ is consistent set of !!{sentence}s
in the language of first-order logic without identity, then it has
!!a{denumerable} model, i.e., it is satisfiable in a !!{structure}
whose domain is infinite and !!{enumerable}.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
If $\Gamma$ is consistent and contains no sentences in which identity
appears, then the !!{structure} $\Struct M$ delivered by the proof of
the completness theorem has a domain $\Domain{M}$ whose cardinality is
identical to that of the set of the terms of the language $\Lang
L$. So $\Struct M$ is denumerably infinite.
\end{proof}
