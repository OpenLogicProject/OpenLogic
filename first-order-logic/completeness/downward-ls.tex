\begin{thm} 
\ollabel{downward-ls}
If $\Gamma$ is consistent then it has a countable model, i.e., it is
satisfiable in a structure whose domain is either finite or
denumerably infinite.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  If $\Gamma$ is consistent, the structure $\Struct M$ delivered by
  the proof of thecompletness theorem has a domain $\Domain{M}$ whose
  cardinality is bounded by that of the set of the terms of the
  language $\Lang L$. So $\Struct M$ is at most denumerably infinite.
\end{proof}
