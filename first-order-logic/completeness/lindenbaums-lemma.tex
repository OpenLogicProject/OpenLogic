\begin{lem}[Lindenbaum's Lemma]
\ollabel{lindenbaum}
Every consistent set~$\Gamma$ can be extended to a maximally
consistent saturated set~$\Gamma^*$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\Gamma$ be consistent, and let $\Gamma'$ be as in the previous
definition: we already proved that $\Gamma \cup \Gamma'$ is a
consistent saturated set in the richer language $\Lang L'$ (with the
countably many new constants). Let $!A_0, !A_1, \dots$ be an
enumeration of all the !p{formula} of~$\Lang L'$. Define $\Gamma_0 =
\Gamma \cup \Gamma'$, and
\[
\Gamma_{n+1} =
\begin{cases}
\Gamma_n \cup \{ !A_n \} & \textrm{if $\Gamma_n \cup \{!A_n\}$ is
  consistent;} \\ 
\Gamma_n \cup \{ \lnot !A_n \} & \textrm{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]

Let $\Gamma^* = \bigcup_{n \geq 0} \Gamma_n$. Since $\Gamma' \subseteq
\Gamma^*$, for each !!{formula}~$!A$, $\Gamma^*$ contains a
!!{formula} of the form
\iftag{prvEx} 
{$\lexists[x][!A] \lif \Subst{!A}{c}{x}$}
{$\lnot\lforall[x][!A] \lif \lnot\Subst{!A}{c}{x}$}
and thus is saturated.

Each $\Gamma_n$ is consistent: $\Gamma_0$ is consistent by
definition. If $\Gamma_{n+1} = \Gamma_n \cup \{!A\}$, this is because
the latter is consistent.  If it isn't, $\Gamma_{n+1} = \Gamma_n \cup
\{!\lnot !A\}$, which must be consistent.  If it weren't, i.e., both
$\Gamma_n \cup \{!A\}$ and $\Gamma_n \cup \{\lnot !A\}$ are
inconsistent, then $\Gamma_n \Proves \lnot !A$ and $\Gamma_n \Proves
!A$, so $\Gamma_n$ would be inconsistent contrary to induction
hypothesis.

Any !!{formula} of $\Frm[L']$ appears on the list used to
define~$\Gamma^*$.  If $!A_n \notin \Gamma^*$, then that is because
$\Gamma_n \cup \{!A_n\}$ was inconsistent.  But that means that
$\Gamma^*$ is maximally consistent.
\end{proof}
