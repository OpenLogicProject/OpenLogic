\olsection{Introduction}

The completeness theorem is one of the most fundamental results about
logic.  It comes in two !!{formula}tions, the equivalence of which we'll
prove. In its first !!{formula}tion it says somethign fundamental about
the relationship between semantic consequence and our proof system: if
a sentences~$!A$ follows from some sentences $\Gamma$, then there is
also a proof of $!A$ from $\Gamma$.  Thus, the proof system is as
strong as it can possibly be without proving things that don't
actually follow.  In its second !!{formula}tion, it can be stated as a
model existence result: every consistent set of sentences is
satisfiable.

These aren't the only reasons the completeness theorem---or rather,
its proof---is important. It has a number of importnat consequences,
some of which we'll discuss separately.  For instance, since any proof
of $!A$ from $\Gamma$ is finite and so can only use finitely many of
the sentences in~$\Gamma$, it follows by the completeness theorem that
if $!A$ is a consequence of $\Gamma$, it is a consequence of already a
finite subset.  This is called \emph{compactness}.  It also follows
from the proof of the completeness theorem that any satisfiable set of
sentences has a finite or !p{denumerable} model. This result is called the
L\"owenheim-Skolem theorem.
