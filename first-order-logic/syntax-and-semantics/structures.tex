\olsection{Structures for First-order Languages}

\begin{explain}
First-order languages are, by themselves, \emph{uninterpreted:} the
constants, functions, and predicates have nospecific meaning attached
to them.  Meanings are given by specifying a \emph{structure}
(somtimes called an \emph{interpretation}).  It specifies the
\emph{domain}, i.e., the objects which the constats pick out, the
functions operate on, and the quantifiers range over. In addition, it
specifies which constants pick out which objects, how a function maps
objects to objects, and which objects the predicates apply to.
Structures are the basis for \emph{semantic} notions in logic, e.g.,
the notion of consequence, validity, satisfiablity.
\end{explain}

\begin{defn}[Structure]
A \emph{structure}, $\Struct{M}$, for a language $\Lang{L}$ of
first-order logic consists of the following elements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Domain:} a non-empty set, $\Domain M$ 
\item \emph{Name assignment:} for each !!{constant} $c$ of
  $\Lang{L}$, an element $\Assign{c}{M} \in \Domain M$
\item \emph{Relations:} for each $n$-place !!{predicate} $R$ of
  $\Lang{L}$ (other than $\eq$), an $n$-ary relation $\Assign{R}{M}
  \subseteq \Domain{M}^n$
\item \emph{Functions:} for each $n$-place !!{function} $\Obj f$ of
  $\Lang{L}$, an $n$-ary function $\Assign{f}{M} \colon
  \Domain{M})^n \to \Domain{M}$
  %Do we mean to have f appear as a sans serif and then as serif?
  %Also, there is a stray parenthesis showing up after |M|)^n
  
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{explain}
Recall that a term is \emph{closed} if it is closed or if it is a
function of constants only (without !p{variable}, whether free or bound).
\end{explain}

\begin{defn}[Denotation of closed terms]
If $t$ is a closed term of the langage~$\Lang L$ and $\Struct M$ i a
!!{structure} for~$\Lang L$, the \emph{denotation}~$\Value{t}{M}$ is
defied as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $t$ is just the constant $c$, then $\Value{c}{M} = \Assign{c}{M}$.
\item If $t$ is of the form $\Atom{f}{t_1, \ldots, t_n}$, then
  $\Value{t}{M}$ is $\Assign{f}{M}(\Value{t_1}{M}, \ldots,
  \Value{t_n}{M})$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Covered !!{structure}]
A !!{structure} is \emph{covered} if every element of the domain is the
denotation of some closed term.
\end{defn}

For example: let ~$\Lang L$ be the language with !p{constant} 
$\mathsf{Zero}, \mathsf{One}, \mathsf{Two}, \ldots$, the binary predicate 
symbols $=$ and $<$, and the binary !p{function} $+$ and $\times$. 
Then a !!{structure} $\Struct M$ for $\Lang L$ is the one with domain 
$\Domain M = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots \}$ and name assignment $\Assign{\mathsf{Zero}}{M}
= 0$, $\Assign{\mathsf{One}}{M} = 1$, $\Assign{\mathsf{Two}}{M} = 2$, and 
so forth. For the binary relation symbol $<$, the set $\Assign{<}{M}$ is the set of all 
pairs $\langle c_1, c_2 \rangle \in \Domain{M}^2$ such that the integer $c_1$ 
is less than the integer $c_2$: for example, $\langle 1, 3 \rangle \in \Value{<}{M}$ 
but $\langle 2, 2 \rangle \notin \Value{<}{M}$. For the binary !!{function} $+$, 
define $\Assign{+}{M}$ in the usual way --- for example, $\Assign{+}{M}(2,3)$ maps 
to $5$, and similarly for the binary !!{function} $\times$. Hence, the 
denotation of $\mathsf{Four}$ is just 4, and the denotation of $\times(\mathsf{Two}, 
+(\mathsf{Three},\mathsf{Zero}))$ (or in infix notation, $\mathsf{Two} \times 
(\mathsf{Three} + \mathsf{Zero})$ ) is

\begin{align*} 
\Value{\times(\mathsf{Two}, +(\mathsf{Three},\mathsf{Zero})}{M}&=
\Assign{\times}{M}(\Value{\mathsf{Two}}{M}, \Value{\mathsf{Two}, 
+(\mathsf{Three}, \mathsf{Zero})}{M})\\
&= \Assign{\times}{M}(\Value{\mathsf{Two}}{M}, \Assign{+}{M}(\Value{\mathsf{Three}}{M}, 
\Value{\mathsf{Zero}}{M})) \\
&= \Assign{\times}{M}(\Assign{\mathsf{Two}}{M}, \Assign{+}{M}(\Assign{\mathsf{Three}}{M}, 
\Assign{\mathsf{Zero}}{M})) \\
&= \Assign{\times}{M}(2, \Assign{+}{M}(3, 0)) \\
&= \Assign{\times}{M}(2, 3) \\
&= 5
\end{align*}

The stipulations we make as to what counts as a !!{structure} impact our
logic. For example, the choice to prevent empty domains ensures, given
the usual account of satisfaction (or truth) for quantified sentences, that
$\lexists[x][(!A(x) \lor \lnot !A(x))]$ is valid --- that is, a logical truth. And the
stipulation that all names must refer to an object in the domain
ensures that the existential generalization is a sound pattern of
inference: $!A(a)$, therefore $\lexists[x][!A(x)]$. If we allowed names
to refer outside the domain, or to not refer, then we would be on our
way to a \emph{free logic}, in which existential generalization
requires an additional premise: $!A(a)$ and $\lexists[x][\eq[x][a]]$,
therefore $\lexists[x][!A(x)]$.
