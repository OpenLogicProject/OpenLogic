% Undefine the prob and probtag environments

\csundef{prob}
\csundef{endprob}
\csundef{probtag}
\csundef{endprobtag}

% Instead, make them into environments which write probdeferred and
% probdeferredtag environments to the problem file using answers.sty

\Newassociation{prob}{probdeferred}{\jobname}
\Newassociation{probtag}{probdeferredtag}{\jobname}

% every prob environment, execute \ifproblems\ifproblemswrite

\pretocmd{\prob}{\ifproblems\ifproblemswrite}{}{}
\pretocmd{\probtag}{\ifproblems\ifproblemswrite}{}{}

% probdeferred and probdeferredtag are just wrappers for theorem
% environments which do the actual typesetting.  answers.sty writes
% the number of the problem into the .prb file, but we throw them away
% and just count them separately. It also throws away the tags. This
% is a bug; actually probtag should deal with the tags but this
% requires hacking answers.sty code.

% for problems per chapter, we want \ifproblems to be
% \makeifproblemsprint at the beginning of each chapter. If there are
% no problems in the chapter, it isn't called and so \ifproblems is
% not redefined. In the end-of-chapter hook it will gobble its
% argument if there were no problems.

\def\makeifproblemsprint#1{\global\let\ifproblems\relax}

% for collected problems, we want \ifproblems to be
% \makeifproblemsgobble at the beginning of a chapter. The first prob
% environment will call it and execute its argument \ifproblemwrite,
% which writes ``Problems for Chapter \thechapter'' into the problems
% file, and then redefine \ifproblem to be \@gobble. Subsequent probs
% in the chapter will then gobble the argument \ifproblemwrite and so
% only one heading is written per chapter.
