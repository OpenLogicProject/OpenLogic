\olsection{\usetoken{S}{derivability} and Consistency}

We will now establish a number of properties of the !!{derivability}
relation.  They are independently interesting, but each will play a
role in the proof of the completeness theorem.

\begin{prop}\ollabel{prop:provability-contr}
  If $\Gamma \Proves !A$ and $\Gamma \cup \{!A\}$ is
  inconsistent, then $\Gamma$ is inconsistent.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
There are finite $\Gamma_0 = \{!B_1, \dots, !B_n\}$ and $\Gamma_1
  =\{!C_1, \dots, !C_n\} \subseteq \Gamma$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    \{\sFmla{\False}{!A}, &
    \sFmla{\True}{!B_1}, \dots, \sFmla{\True}{!B_n}\} \\
    \{\sFmla{\True}{\lnot !A}, &
    \sFmla{\True}{!C_1}, \dots, \sFmla{\True}{!C_m}\}
  \end{align*}
  have closed !!{tableau}s.  Using the \Cut{} rule on $!A$ we can
  combine these into a single closed !!{tableau} that shows $\Gamma_0
  \cup \Gamma_1$ is inconsistent.  Since $\Gamma_0
  \subseteq \Gamma$ and $\Gamma_1 \subseteq \Gamma$, $\Gamma_0 \cup
  \Gamma_1 \subseteq \Gamma$, hence $\Gamma$~is inconsistent.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\ollabel{prop:prov-incons}
$\Gamma \Proves !A$ iff $\Gamma \cup \{\lnot !A\}$ is inconsistent.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
First suppose $\Gamma \Proves !A$, i.e., there is
a closed !!{tableau} for
\[
\{\sFmla{\False}{!A},
\sFmla{\True}{!B_1}, \dots, \sFmla{\True}{!B_n}\}
\]
Using the $\TRule{\True}{\lnot}$ rule, this can be turned into a
closed !!{tableau} for
\[
\{\sFmla{\True}{\lnot !A},
\sFmla{\True}{!B_1}, \dots, \sFmla{\True}{!B_n}\}.
\]

On the other hand, if there is a closed !!{tableau} for the latter, we
can turn it into a closed !!{tableau} of the former by removing every
formula that results from \TRule{\True}{\lnot} applied to the first
assumption~$\sFmla{\True}{\lnot !A}$ as well as that assumption, and
adding the assumption $\sFmla{\False}{!A}$. For if a branch was closed
before because it contained the conclusion of \TRule{\True}{\lnot}
applied to $\sFmla{\True}{\lnot !A}$, i.e., $\sFmla{\False}{!A}$, the
corresponding branch in the new !!{tableau} is also closed. If a
branch in the old tableau was closed because it contained the
assumption $\sFmla{\True}{\lnot !A}$ as well as $\sFmla{\False}{\lnot
  !A}$ we can turn it into a closed branch by applying
$\TRule{\False}{\lnot}$ to $\sFmla{\False}{\lnot !A}$ to obtain
$\sFmla{\True}{!A}$. This closes the branch since we added
$\sFmla{\False}{!A}$ as an assumption.
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
Prove that $\Gamma \Proves \lnot !A$ iff $\Gamma \cup \{!A\}$ is inconsistent.
\end{prob}

\begin{prop}\ollabel{prop:explicit-inc}
  If $\Gamma \Proves !A$ and $\lnot !A \in \Gamma$, then $\Gamma$ is
  inconsistent.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\Gamma \Proves !A$ and $\lnot !A \in \Gamma$.  Then there
  are $!B_1$, \dots, $!B_n \in \Gamma$ such that \
  \[
  \{\sFmla{\False}{!A}, \sFmla{\True}{!B_1}, \dots, \sFmla{\True}{!B_n}\}
  \]
  has a closed tableau. Replace the assumption \sFmla{\False}{!A} by
  \sFmla{\True}{\lnot !A}, and insert the conclusion of
  \TRule{\True}{\lnot} applied to \sFmla{\False}{!A} after the
  assumptions. Any !!{sentence} in the !!{tableau} justified by appeal
  to line~$1$ in the old !!{tableau} is now justified by appeal to
  line~$n+1$. So if the old !!{tableau} was closed, the new one is.
  It shows that $\Gamma$ is inconsistent, since all assumptions are
  in~$\Gamma$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\ollabel{prop:provability-exhaustive}
  If $\Gamma \cup \{!A\}$ and $\Gamma \cup \{\lnot !A\}$ are both
  inconsistent, then $\Gamma$ is inconsistent.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  If there are $!B_1$, \dots, $!B_n \in \Gamma$ and $!C_1$, \dots,
  $!C_m \in \Gamma$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    \{\sFmla{\True}{!A}, &
    \sFmla{\True}{!B_1}, \dots, \sFmla{\True}{!B_n}\} \\
    \{\sFmla{\True}{\lnot !A}, &
    \sFmla{\True}{!C_1}, \dots, \sFmla{\True}{!C_m}\}
  \end{align*}
  both have closed !!{tableau}s, we can construct !!a{tableau} that
  shows that $\Gamma$ is inconsistent by using as assumptions
  $\sFmla{\True}{!B_1}$, \dots, $\sFmla{\True}{!B_n}$ together with
  $\sFmla{\True}{!C_1}$, \dots, $\sFmla{\True}{!C_m}$, followed by an
  application of the \Cut{} rule, yielding two branches, one starting
  with $\sFmla{\True}{!A}$, the other with $\sFmla{\False}{!A}$. Add
  on the part below the assumptions of the first !!{tableau} on the
  left side. Here, every rule application is still correct, and every
  branch closes. On the right side, add the part below the assumptions
  of the seond !!{tableau}, with the results of any applications
  of~$\TRule{\True}{\lnot}$ to $\sFmla{\True}{\lnot !A}$ removed.

  For if a branch was closed before because it contained the
  conclusion of \TRule{\True}{\lnot} applied to $\sFmla{\True}{\lnot
    !A}$, i.e., $\sFmla{\False}{!A}$, as well as $\sFmla{\False}{!A}$,
  the corresponding branch in the new !!{tableau} is also closed. If a
  branch in the old tableau was closed because it contained the
  assumption $\sFmla{\True}{\lnot !A}$ as well as
  $\sFmla{\False}{\lnot !A}$ we can turn it into a closed branch by
  applying $\TRule{\False}{\lnot}$ to $\sFmla{\False}{\lnot !A}$ to
  obtain $\sFmla{\True}{!A}$.
  \end{proof}
