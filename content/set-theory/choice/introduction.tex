\olsection{Introduction}

In \crefrange{sth:cardinals::chap}{sth:card-arithmetic::chap}, we
developed a theory of cardinals by treating cardinals as ordinals.
That approach depends upon the Axiom of Well-Ordering. It turns out
that Well-Ordering is equivalent to another principle---the Axiom of
Choice---and there has been serious philosophical discussion of its
acceptability. Our question for this chapter are: How is the Axiom
used, and can it be justified?
