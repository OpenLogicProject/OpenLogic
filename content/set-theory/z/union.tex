\olref[sth][z][sep]{prop:intersectionsexist} gave us intersections.
But if we want arbitrary unions to exist, we need to lay down another
axiom:

\begin{axiom}[Union] For any set $A$, the set $\bigcup A =
\Setabs{x}{(\exists b \in A) x \in b}$ exists.
\[
	\forall A \exists U \forall x(x \in U \liff (\exists b \in A)x \in b)
\]
\end{axiom}

This axiom is also justified by the cumulative-iterative conception.
Let $A$ be a set, so $A$ is formed at some stage $S$ (by \stageshier).
Every member of $A$ was formed \emph{before}  $S$ (by \stagesacc); so,
reasoning similarly, every member of every member of $A$ was formed
before $S$. Thus all of \emph{those} sets are available before $S$, to
be formed into a set at $S$. And that set is just $\bigcup A$.
