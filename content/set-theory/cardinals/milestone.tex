\olsection{$\ZFC$: A Milestone}

With the addition of Well-Ordering, we have reached the final
theoretical milestone. We now have all the axioms required for~$\ZFC$.
In detail:

\begin{defn}
The theory $\ZFC$ has these axioms: Extensionality, Union, Pairs,
Powersets, Infinity, Foundation, Well-Ordering and all instances of
the Separation and Replacement schemes. Otherwise put, $\ZFC$ adds
Well-Ordering to~$\ZF$. 
\end{defn}

$\ZFC$ stands for \emph{Zermelo-Fraenkel} set theory with
\emph{Choice}. Now this might seem slightly odd, since the axiom we
added was called ``Well-Ordering'', not ``Choice''. But, when we later
formulate {Choice}, it will turn out that Well-Ordering is equivalent
(modulo~$\ZF$) to Choice (see \olref[choice][woproblem]{thmwochoice}).
So which to take as our ``basic'' axiom is a matter of indifference.
And the name ``$\ZFC$'' is entirely standard in the literature.
