\olsection{Soundness for \Log{K}}

\begin{editorial}
  This soundness proof reuses the soundness proof for classical
  propositional logic, i.e., it proves everything from scratch. That's
  ok if you want a self-contained soundness proof. If you already have
  seen soundness for ordinary tableau this will be repetitive. It's
  planned to make it possible to switch between self-contained version
  and a version building on the non-modal case.
\end{editorial}

\begin{explain}
  In order to show that prefixed !!{tableau}s are sound, we have to
  show that if
  \[
  \sFmla{\True}{!B_1}[1], \dots, \sFmla{\True}{!B_n}[1], \sFmla{\False}{!A}[1]
  \]
  has a closed !!{tableau} then $!B_1, \dots, !B_n \Entails !A$. It is
  easier to prove the contrapositive: if for some $\mModel{M}$ and
  world~$w$, $\mSat{M}{!B_i}[w]$ for all $i=1$, \dots,~$n$ but
  $\mSat{M}{!A}[w]$, then no !!{tableau} can close. Such a
  countermodel shows that the initial assumptions of the !!{tableau}
  are satisfiable. The strategy of the proof is to show that whenever
  all the prefixed !!{formula}s on !!a{tableau} branch are
  satisfiable, any application of a rule results in at least one
  extended branch that is also satisfiable. Since closed branches are
  unsatisfiable, any !!{tableau} for a satisfiable set of prefixed
  !!{formula}s must have at least one open branch.

  In order to apply this strategy in the modal case, we have to extend
  our definition of ``satisfiable'' to modal modals and prefixes. With
  that in hand, however, the proof is straightforward.
\end{explain}

\begin{defn}
  Let $P$ be some set of prefixes, i.e., $P \subseteq (\PosInt)^*
  \setminus \{\emptyseq\}$ and let $\mModel{M}$ be a model.  A
  function~$f\colon P \to W$ is an \emph{interpretation of}~$P$
  in~$\mModel{M}$ if, whenever $\sigma$ and $\sigma.n$ are both
  in~$P$, then $Rf(\sigma)f(\sigma.n)$.

  Relative to an interpretation of prefixes~$P$ we can define:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\mModel{M}$ satisfies $\sFmla{\True}{!A}[\sigma]$ iff
    $\mSat{M}{!A}[f(\sigma)]$.
  \item $\mModel{M}$ satisfies $\sFmla{\False}{!A}[\sigma]$ iff
    $\mSat/{M}{!A}[f(\sigma)]$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  Let $\Gamma$ be a set of prefixed !!{formula}s, and let $P(\Gamma)$
  be the set of prefixes that occur in it. If $f$ is an interpretation
  of~$P(\Gamma)$ in $\mModel{M}$, we say that $\mModel{M}$ satisfies
  $\Gamma$ with respect to~$f$, $\mSat{M}{\Gamma}[f]$, if $\mModel{M}$
  satisfies every prefixed !!{formula} in~$\Gamma$ with respect
  to~$f$. $\Gamma$ is \emph{satisfiable} iff there is a
  model~$\mModel{M}$ and interpretation~$f$ of $P(\Gamma)$ such that
  $\mSat{M}{\Gamma}[f]$.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
  If $\Gamma$ contains both $\sFmla{\True}{!A}[\sigma]$ and
  $\sFmla{\False}{!A}[\sigma]$, for some !!{formula}~$!A$ and
  prefix~$\sigma$, then $\Gamma$ is unsatisfiable.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  There cannot be a model~$\mModel{M}$ and interpretation~$f$ of
  $P(\Gamma)$ such that both $\mSat{M}{!A}[f(\sigma)]$ and
  $\mSat/{M}{!A}[f(\sigma)]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Soundness]
  \ollabel{thm:tableau-soundness}
  If $\Gamma$ has a closed !!{tableau}, $\Gamma$ is unsatisfiable.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We call a branch of !!a{tableau} satisfiable iff the set of
!!{signed formula}s on it is satisfiable, and let's call !!a{tableau}
satisfiable if it contains at least one satisfiable branch.

We show the following: Extending a satisfiable !!{tableau} by one of
the rules of inference always results in a satisfiable !!{tableau}.
This will prove the theorem: any closed !!{tableau} results by
applying rules of inference to the !!{tableau} consisting only of
assumptions from~$\Gamma$. So if $\Gamma$ were satisfiable, any
!!{tableau} for it would be satisfiable. A closed !!{tableau},
however, is clearly not satisfiable, since all its branches are closed
and closed branches are unsatisfiable.

Suppose we have a satisfiable !!{tableau}, i.e., !!a{tableau} with at
least one satisfiable branch. Applying a rule of inference either adds
!!{signed formula}s to a branch, or splits a branch in two. If the
!!{tableau} has a satisfiable branch which is not extended by the rule
application in question, it remains a satisfiable branch in the
extended !!{tableau}, so the extended tableau is satisfiable. So we
only have to consider the case where a rule is applied to a
satisfiable branch.

Let $\Gamma$ be the set of !!{signed formula}s on that branch, and let
$\sFmla{S}{!A}[\sigma] \in \Gamma$ be the !!{signed formula} to which
the rule is applied. If the rule does not result in a split branch, we
have to show that the extended branch, i.e., $\Gamma$ together with
the conclusions of the rule, is still satisfiable. If the rule results
in split branch, we have to show that at least one of the two
resulting branches is satisfiable.
\tagfalse{prvDiamond}
First, we consider the possible inferences with only one premise.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The branch is expanded by applying $\TRule{\True}{\lnot}$ to
  $\sFmla{\True}{\lnot !B}[\sigma] \in \Gamma$. Then the extended
  branch contains the !!{signed formula}s $\Gamma \cup
  \{\sFmla{\False}{!B}[\sigma]\}$.  Suppose $\mSat{M}{\Gamma}[f]$. In
  particular, $\mSat{M}{\lnot !B}[f(\sigma)]$. Thus,
  $\mSat/{M}{!B}[f(\sigma)]$, i.e., $\mModel{M}$ satisfies
  $\sFmla{\False}{!B}[\sigma]$ with respect to~$f$.
\item The branch is expanded by applying $\TRule{\False}{\lnot}$ to
  $\sFmla{\False}{\lnot !B}[\sigma] \in \Gamma$: Exercise.
\item The branch is expanded by applying $\TRule{\True}{\land}$ to
  $\sFmla{\True}{!B \land !C}[\sigma] \in \Gamma$, which results in
  two new !!{signed formula}s on the branch:
  $\sFmla{\True}{!B}[\sigma]$ and $\sFmla{\True}{!C}[\sigma]$. Suppose
  $\mSat{M}{\Gamma}[f]$, in particular $\mSat{M}{!B \land
    !C}[f(\sigma)]$. Then $\mSat{M}{!B}[f(\sigma)]$ and
  $\mSat{M}{!C}[f(\sigma)]$. This means that $\mModel{M}$ satisfies
  both $\sFmla{\True}{!B}[\sigma]$ and $\sFmla{\True}{!C}[\sigma]$
  with respect to~$f$.
\item The branch is expanded by applying $\TRule{\False}{\lor}$ to
  $\sFmla{\False}{!B \lor !C} \in \Gamma$: Exercise.
\item The branch is expanded by applying $\TRule{\False}{\lif}$ to
  $\sFmla{\False}{!B \lif !C}[\sigma] \in \Gamma$: This results in two
  new !!{signed formula}s on the branch: $\sFmla{\True}{!B}[\sigma]$ and
  $\sFmla{\False}{!C}[\sigma]$. Suppose
  $\mSat{M}{\Gamma}[f]$, in particular
  $\mSat/{M}{!B \lif !C}[f(\sigma)]$. Then
  $\mSat{M}{!B}[f(\sigma)]$ and
  $\mSat/{M}{!C}[f(\sigma)]$. This means that
  $\mModel{M}, f$ satisfies both
  $\sFmla{\True}{!B}[\sigma]$ and $\sFmla{\False}{!C}[\sigma]$.

\iftag{prvBox}{%
\item The branch is expanded by applying $\TRule{\True}{\Box}$ to
  $\sFmla{\True}{\Box !B}[\sigma] \in \Gamma$:
  \iftag{probBox}{Exercise.}{This results in a new !!{signed
      formula}~$\sFmla{\True}{!B}[\sigma.n]$ on the branch, for some
    $\sigma.n \in P(\Gamma)$ (since $\sigma.n$ must be used).  Suppose
    $\mSat{M}{\Gamma}[f]$, in particular, $\mSat{M}{\Box
      !B}[f(\sigma)]$. Since $f$ is an interpretation of prefixes and
    both $\sigma$, $\sigma.n \in P(\Gamma)$, we know that
    $Rf(\sigma)f(\sigma.n)$.  Hence, $\mSat{M}{!B}[f(\sigma.n)]$,
    i.e., $\mModel{M}, f$ satisfies $\sFmla{\True}{!B}[\sigma.n]$.}

\item The branch is expanded by applying $\TRule{\False}{\Box}$ to
  $\sFmla{\False}{\Box !B}[\sigma] \in \Gamma$:
  \iftag{probBox}{Exercise.}{This results in a new !!{signed
      formula}~$\sFmla{\False}{!A}[\sigma.n]$, where $\sigma.n$ is a
    new prefix on the branch, i.e., $\sigma.n \notin P(\Gamma)$.
    Since $\Gamma$ is satisfiable, there is a $\Struct{M}$ and
    interpretation~$f$ of $P(\Gamma)$ such that $\Sat{M}{\Gamma}[f]$,
    in particular $\mSat/{M}{\Box !B}[f(\sigma)]$. We have to show
    that $\Gamma \cup \{\sFmla{\False}{!B}[\sigma.n]\}$ is
    satisfiable. To do this, we define an interpretation of $P(\Gamma)
    \cup \{\sigma.n\}$ as follows:

  Since $\mSat/{M}{\Box !B}[f(\sigma)]$, there is a $w \in W$ such that
  $Rf(\sigma)w$ and $\mSat/{M}{!B}[w]$. Let $f'$ be like $f$, except
  that $f'(\sigma.n) = w$. Since $f'(\sigma) = f(\sigma)$ and
  $Rf(\sigma)w$, we have $Rf'(\sigma)f'(\sigma.n)$, so $f'$ is an
  interpretation of $P(\Gamma) \cup \{\sigma.n\}$.  Obviously
  $\mSat/{M}{!B}[f'(\sigma.n)]$. Since $f(\sigma') = f'(\sigma')$ for
  all prefixes $\sigma' \in P(\Gamma)$, $\mSat{M}{\Gamma}[f']$.  So,
  $\mModel{M}, f'$ satisfies $\Gamma \cup
  \{\sFmla{\False}{!B}[\sigma.n]\}$.}

\iftag{prvDiamond}{%
\item The branch is expanded by applying $\TRule{\True}{\Diamond}$ to
  $\sFmla{\True}{\Diamond !B}[\sigma] \in \Gamma$:
  \iftag{probDiamond}{Exercise.}{This results in a new !!{signed
      formula}~$\sFmla{\True}{!A}[\sigma.n]$, where $\sigma.n$ is a

    Since $\Gamma$ is satisfiable, there is a $\Struct{M}$ and
    interpretation~$f$ of $P(\Gamma)$ such that $\Sat{M}{\Gamma}[f]$,
    in particular $\mSat{M}{\Diamond !B}[f(\sigma)]$. We have to show
    that $\Gamma \cup \{\sFmla{\True}{!B}[\sigma.n]\}$ is
    satisfiable. To do this, we define an interpretation of $P(\Gamma)

  $\mSat{M}{!B}[f'(\sigma.n)]$. Since $f(\sigma') = f'(\sigma')$ for

  $\mModel{M}, f'$ satisfies $\Gamma \cup

  \iftag{probDiamond}{Exercise.}{This results in a new !!{signed

  }{}
\end{enumerate}
Now let's consider the possible inferences with two premises.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The branch is expanded by applying $\TRule{\False}{\land}$ to
  $\sFmla{\False}{!B \land !C}[\sigma] \in \Gamma$, which results in
  two branches, a left one continuing through
  $\sFmla{\False}{!B}[\sigma]$ and a right one through
  $\sFmla{\False}{!C}[\sigma]$. Suppose $\mSat{M}{\Gamma}[f]$, in
  particular $\mSat/{M}{!B \land !C}[f(\sigma)]$.  Then
  $\mSat/{M}{!B}[f(\sigma)]$ or $\mSat/{M}{!C}[f(\sigma)]$. In the
  former case, $\mModel{M}, f$ satisfies $\sFmla{\False}{!B}[\sigma]$,
  i.e., the left branch is satisfiable. In the latter, $\mModel{M}, f$
  satisfies $\sFmla{\False}{!C}[\sigma]$, i.e., the right branch is
  satisfiable.
\item The branch is expanded by applying $\TRule{\True}{\lor}$ to
    $\sFmla{\True}{!B \lor !C}[\sigma] \in \Gamma$: Exercise.
\item The branch is expanded by applying $\TRule{\True}{\lif}$ to
    $\sFmla{\True}{!B \lif !C}[\sigma] \in \Gamma$: Exercise.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{prob}
Complete the proof of \olref[nml][tab][sou]{thm:tableau-soundness}.
\end{prob}

\begin{cor}
\ollabel{cor:entailment-soundness}
If $\Gamma \Proves !A$ then $\Gamma \Entails !A$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
  If $\Gamma \Proves !A$ then for some $!B_1$, \dots, $!B_n \in
  \Gamma$, $\Delta = \{\sFmla{\False}{!A}[1], \sFmla{\True}{!B_1}[1],
  \dots, \sFmla{\True}{!B_n}[1]\}$ has a closed !!{tableau}. We want
  to show that $\Gamma \Entails !A$. Suppose not, so for some
  $\mModel{M}$ and $w$, $\mSat{M}{!B_i}[w]$ for $i=1$, \dots,~$n$, but
  $\mSat/{M}{!A}[w]$. Let $f(1) = w$; then $f$ is an interpretation
  of~$P(\Delta)$ into~$\mModel{M}$, and $\mModel{M}$ satisfies~$\Delta$ with
  respect to~$f$. But by \olref{thm:tableau-soundness}, $\Delta$ is
  unsatisfiable since it has a closed !!{tableau}, a
  contradiction. So we must have $\Gamma \Proves !A$ after all.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
\ollabel{cor:weak-soundness}
If $\Proves !A$ then $!A$ is true in all models.
