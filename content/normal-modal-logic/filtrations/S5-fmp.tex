\olsection{\Log{S5} has the Finite Model Property}

\begin{defn}
  A system $\Sigma$ of modal logic is said to have the \emph{finite
    model property} if whenever !!a{formula} $!A$ is true at a world
  in a model of $\Sigma$ then $!A$ is true at a world in a
  \emph{finite} model of $\Sigma$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}\ollabel{prop:univ-fin}
  Let $\mClass{U}$ be the class of universal models (see
  \olref[syn][es5]{prop:S5=univ}) and $\mClass{U}_\mathrm{Fin}$ the
  class of all finite universal models. Then any !!{formula} $!A$ is
  valid in $\mClass{U}$ if and only if it is valid in
  $\mClass{U}_\mathrm{Fin}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  Finite universal models are universal models, so the left-to-right
  direction is trivial. For the right-to left direction, suppose
  that~$!A$ is false at some world $w$ in a universal model
  $\mModel{M}$. Let $\Gamma$ contain $!A$ as well as all of its
  subformulas; clearly $\Gamma$ is finite. Take a filtration
  $\mModel{M^*}$ of $\mModel{M}$; then $\mModel{M^*}$ is finite by
  \olref[fin]{prop:filt-are-finite}, and by
  \olref[fil]{thm:filtrations}, $!A$ is false at $[w]$ in
  $\mModel{M^*}$. It remains to observe that $\mModel{M^*}$ is also
  universal: given $u$ and $v$, by hypothesis $Ruv$ and by
  Definition~\olref[fil]{def:filtration}\olref[fil]{def:filtration-R},
  also $R^*[u][v]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\ollabel{cor:S5fmp}
  \Log{S5} has the finite model property.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
  By \olref[syn][es5]{prop:S5=univ} and
  \olref{prop:univ-fin}, if $!A$ is true at a world in some reflexive
  and euclidean model then it is true at a world in a finite universal
  model (universal models are obviously reflexive and euclidean).
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
  Show that any filtration of a serial or reflexive model is also
  serial or reflexive (respectively).
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
  Find a non-symmetric (non-transitive, non-euclidean) filtration of a
  symmetric (transitive, euclidean) model.
\end{prob}
