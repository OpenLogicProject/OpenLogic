\olsection{Filtrations are Finite}

We've defined filtrations for any set~$\Gamma$ that is closed under
sub-!!{formula}s. Nothing in the definition itself guarantees that
filtrations are finite. In fact, when $\Gamma$ is infinite (e.g., is
the set of all !!{formula}s), it may well be infinite. However, if
$\Gamma$ is finite (e.g., when it is the set of sub-!!{formula}s of a
given !!{formula}~$!A$), so is any filtration through~$\Gamma$.

\begin{prop}\ollabel{prop:filt-are-finite}
  If $\Gamma$ is finite then any filtration $\mModel{M^*}$ of a model
  $\mModel{M}$ through $\Gamma$ is also finite.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  The size of $W^*$ is the number of different classes~$[w]$ under the
  equivalence relation~$\equiv$. Any two worlds $u$, $v$ in such
  class---that is, any $u$ and $v$ such that~$u \equiv v$---agree on
  all !!{formula}s~$!A$ in~$\Gamma$, $!A \in \Gamma$ either $!A$ is
  true at both $u$ and $v$, or at neither. So each class~$[w]$
  corresponds to subset of~$\Gamma$, namely the set of all $!A \in
  \Gamma$ such that $!A$ is true at the worlds in~$[w]$. No two
  different classes $[u]$ and $[v]$ correspond to the same subset
  of~$\Gamma$. For if the set of !!{formula}s true at $u$ and that of
  !!{formula}s true at $v$ are the same, then $u$ and $v$ agree on all
  formulas in~$\Gamma$, i.e., $u \equiv v$. But then $[u] = [v]$.  So,
  there is !!a{injective} function from $W^*$ to $\Pow{\Gamma}$, and
  hence $\card{W^*} \le \card{\Pow{\Gamma}}$.  Hence if $\Gamma$
  contains $n$ sentences, the cardinality of $W^*$ is no greater
  than~$2^n$.
\end{proof}
