\olsection{The First Incompleteness Theorem}

We can now describe G\"odel's original proof of the first
incompleteness theorem. Let $\Th{T}$ be any computably axiomatized theory
in a language extending the language of arithmetic, such that $\Th{T}$
includes the axioms of $\Th{Q}$. This means that, in particular, $\Th{T}$
represents computable functions and relations.

We have argued that, given a reasonable coding of formulas and proofs
as numbers, the relation $\Prf[T](x,y)$ is computable, where
$\Prf[T](x,y)$ holds if and only if $x$ is the G\"odel number of
!!a{derivation} of the !!{formula} with G\"odel number~$y$
in~$\Th{T}$. In fact, for the particular theory that G\"odel had in
mind, G\"odel was able to show that this relation is primitive
recursive, using the list of 45 functions and relations in his
paper. The 45th relation, $x B y$, is just $\Prf[T](x,y)$ for his
particular choice of~$\Th{T}$. Remember that where G\"odel uses the
word ``recursive'' in his paper, we would now use the phrase
``primitive recursive.''

Since $\Prf[T](x,y)$ is computable, it is representable in $\Th{T}$. We
will use $\OPrf[T](x,y)$ to refer to the formula that represents
it. Let $\OProv[T](y)$ be the formula
$\lexists[x][\OPrf[T](x,y)]$. This describes the 46th relation,
$\fn{Bew}(y)$, on G\"odel's list. As G\"odel notes, this is the only
relation that ``cannot be asserted to be recursive.''  What he
probably meant is this: from the definition, it is not clear that it
is computable; and later developments, in fact, show that it isn't.

\begin{defn}
\ollabel{thm:oconsis-q}
A theory $\Th{T}$ is $\omega$-consistent if the following holds: if
$\lexists[x][!A(x)]$ is any sentence and $\Th{T}$ proves $\lnot
!A(\num 0)$, $\lnot !A(\num 1)$, $\lnot !A(\num 2)$, \dots then $\Th{T}$
does not prove $\lexists[x][!A(x)]$.
\end{defn}

We can now prove the following.
\begin{thm}
\ollabel{thm:first-incompleteness} Let $\Th{T}$ be any
$\omega$-consistent, !!{axiomatizable} theory extending~$\Th{Q}$. Then
$\Th{T}$ is not complete.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $\Th{T}$ be an !!{axiomatizable} theory containing~$\Th{Q}$ Then
$\Prf[T](x, y)$ is decidable, hence representable in~$\Th{Q}$ by
!!a{formula}~$\OPrf[T](x, y)$. Let $\OProv[T](y)$ be the formula we
described above. By the fixed-point lemma, there is a formula
$!G_\Th{T}$ such that $\Th{Q}$ (and hence $\Th{T}$) proves
\begin{equation}
\ollabel{eqn:qpf}
!G_\Th{T} \liff \lnot \OProv[T](\gn{!G_\Th{T}}).
\end{equation}
Note that $!A$ says, in essence, ``$!A$ is not provable.''

We claim that
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\Th{T}$ is consistent, $\Th{T}$ doesn't prove $!G_\Th{T}$
\item If $\Th{T}$ is $\omega$-consistent, $\Th{T}$ doesn't prove
  $\lnot !G_\Th{T}$.
\end{enumerate}
This means that if $\Th{T}$ is $\omega$-consistent, it is incomplete,
since it proves neither $!G_\Th{T}$ nor $\lnot !G_\Th{T}$. Let us take
each claim in turn.

Suppose $\Th{T}$ proves $!G_\Th{T}$. Then there \emph{is}
!!a{derivation}, and so, for some number $m$, the relation $\Prf[T](m,
\Gn{!G_\Th{T}})$ holds. But then $\Th{Q}$ proves the sentence
$\OPrf[T](\num m, \gn{!G_\Th{T}})$. So $\Th{Q}$ proves
$\lexists[x][\OPrf[T](x,\gn{!G_\Th{T}})]$, which is, by definition,
$\OProv[T](\gn{!G_\Th{T}})$. By \olref{eqn:qpf}, $\Th{Q}$ proves
$\lnot !G_\Th{T}$, and since $\Th{T}$ extends $\Th{Q}$, so
does~$\Th{T}$. We have shown that if $\Th{T}$ proves $!G_\Th{T}$, then
it also proves $\lnot !G_\Th{T}$, and hence it would be inconsistent.

For the second claim, let us show that if $\Th{T}$ proves $\lnot
!G_\Th{T}$, then it is $\omega$-inconsistent. Suppose $\Th{T}$ proves
$\lnot !G_\Th{T}$. If $\Th{T}$ is inconsistent, it is
$\omega$-inconsistent, and we are done. Otherwise, $\Th{T}$ is
consistent, so it does not prove $!G_\Th{T}$. Since there is no proof
of $!G_\Th{T}$ in $\Th{T}$, $\Th{Q}$ proves
\[
\lnot \OPrf[T](\num 0, \gn{!G_\Th{T}}), \lnot \OPrf[T](\num 1,
\gn{!G_\Th{T}}), \lnot \OPrf[T](\num 2, \gn{!G_\Th{T}}), \dots
\]
and so does~$\Th{T}$.  On the other hand, by \olref{eqn:qpf}, $\lnot
!G_\Th{T}$ is equivalent to
$\lexists[x][\OPrf[T](x,\gn{!G_\Th{T}})]$. So $\Th{T}$ is
$\omega$-inconsistent.
\end{proof}
