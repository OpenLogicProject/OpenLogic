\olsection{Representing Relations}
Let us say what it means for a \emph{relation} to be representable.

\begin{defn}
\ollabel{defn:representing-relations}
  A relation $R(x_0,\dots,x_k)$ on the natural numbers is {\em
    representable in $\Th{Q}$} if there is a formula
  $!A_R(x_0,\dots,x_k)$ such that whenever $R(n_0,\dots,n_k)$ is
  true, $\Th{Q}$ proves $!A_R(\num n_0,\dots,\num n_k)$, and whenever
  $R(n_0,\dots,n_k)$ is false, $\Th{Q}$ proves $\lnot !A_R(\num
  n_0,\dots,\num n_k)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
\ollabel{thm:representing-rels}
  A relation is representable in $\Th{Q}$ if and only if it is computable.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
For the forwards direction, suppose $R(x_0,\dots,x_k)$ is
represented by the formula $!A_R(x_0,\dots,x_k)$. Here is an
algorithm for computing $R$: on input $n_0,\dots,n_k$, simultaneously
search for a proof of $!A_R(\num n_0,\dots,\num n_k)$ and a proof of
$\lnot !A_R(\num n_0,\dots,\num n_k)$. By our hypothesis, the search
is bound to find one of the other; if it is the first, report ``yes,''
and otherwise, report ``no.''

In the other direction, suppose $R(x_0,\dots,x_k)$ is computable. By
definition, this means that the function $\chi_R(x_0,\dots,x_k)$ is
computable. By \olref[int]{thm:representable-iff-comp}, $\chi_R$ is
represented by a formula, say $!A_{\chi_R}(x_0,\dots,x_k,y)$. Let
$!A_R(x_0,\dots,x_k)$ be the formula $!A_{\chi_R}(x_0,\dots,x_k,\num
1)$. Then for any $n_0,\dots,n_k$, if $R(n_0,\dots,n_k)$ is true, then
$\chi_R(n_0,\dots,n_k) = 1$, in which case $\Th{Q}$ proves
$!A_{\chi_R}(\num n_0,\dots,\num n_k,\num 1)$, and so $\Th{Q}$ proves
$!A_R(\num n_0,\dots,\num n_k)$. On the other hand if
$R(n_0,\dots,n_k)$ is false, then $\chi_R(n_0,\dots,n_k) = 0$. This
means that $\Th{Q}$ proves $!A_{\chi_R}(\num n_0,\dots,\num n_k,y)
\lif y = \num 0$. Since $\Th{Q}$ proves $\lnot (\num 0 = \num 1)$,
$\Th{Q}$ proves $\lnot !A_{\chi_R}(\num n_0,\dots,\num n_k,\num 1)$,
and so it proves $\lnot !A_R(\num n_0,\dots,\num n_k)$.
\end{proof}
