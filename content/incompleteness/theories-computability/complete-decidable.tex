\olsection{\printtoken{S}{axiomatizable} Complete Theories are Decidable}

A theory is said to be {\em complete} if for every sentence $!A$,
either $!A$ or $\lnot !A$ is provable.

\begin{lem}
Suppose a theory $\Th{T}$ is complete and !!{axiomatizable}. Then
$\Th{T}$ is decidable.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $\Th{T}$ is complete and $A$ is a computable set of axioms.
If $\Th{T}$ is inconsistent, it is clearly computable. (Algorithm: ``just
say yes.'') So we can assume that $\Th{T}$ is also consistent.

To decide whether or not a sentence $!A$ is in~$\Th{T}$,
simultaneously search for !!a{derivation} of~$!A$ from~$\Th{T}$ and
!!a{derivation} of~$\lnot !A$. Since $\Th{T}$ is complete, you are
bound to find one or the other; and since $\Th{T}$ is consistent, if you
find !!a{derivation} of~$\lnot !A$, there is no !!{derivation} of~$!A$.

Put in different terms, we already know that $\Th{T}$ is !!{c.e.}; so
by a theorem we proved before, it suffices to show that the complement
of~$\Th{T}$ is !!{c.e.} also. But !!a{formula}~$!A$ is in~$\Th{\bar
T}$ if and only if $\lnot !A$ is in~$\Th{T}$; so $\Th{\bar T} \leq_m
\Th{T}$.
\end{proof}
