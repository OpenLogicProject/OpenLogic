\olsection{Computably Axiomatizable Complete Theories are Decidable}

A theory is said to be {\em complete} if for every sentence $!A$,
either $!A$ or $\lnot !A$ is provable.

\begin{lem}
Suppose a theory $\Th{T}$ is complete and computably axiomatizable. Then
$\Th{T}$ is decidable.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $\Th{T}$ is complete and $A$ is a computable set of axioms.
If $\Th{T}$ is inconsistent, it is clearly computable. (Algorithm: ``just
say yes.'') So we can assume that $\Th{T}$ is also consistent.

To decide whether or not a sentence $!A$ is in $\Th{T}$, simultaneously
search for a proof of $!A$ from $A$ and a proof of $\lnot !A$. Since
$\Th{T}$ is complete, you are bound to find one or another; and since $\Th{T}$
is consistent, if you find a proof of $\lnot !A$, there is no proof
of $!A$.

Put in different terms, we already know that $\Th{T}$ is c.e.; so by a
theorem we proved before, it suffices to show that the complement of
$\Th{T}$ is c.e. But a formula $!A$ is in $\num T$ if and only if $\lnot
!A$ is in $\Th{T}$; so $\num T \leq_m T$.
\end{proof}
