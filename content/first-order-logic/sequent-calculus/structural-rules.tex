\olsection{Structural Rules}

We also need a few rules that allow us to rearrange !!{sentence}s in
the left and right side of a sequent.  Since the logical rules require
that the !!{sentence}s in the premise which the rule acts upon stand
either to the far left or to the far right, we need an ``exchange''
rule that allows us to move !!{sentence}s to the right position.  It's
also important sometimes to be able to combine two identical
!!{sentence}s into one, and to add !!a{sentence} on either side.

\subsection{Weakening}

\begin{defish}
\Axiom$ \Gamma \fCenter \Delta $
\RightLabel{\LeftR{\Weakening}}
\UnaryInf$ !A, \Gamma \fCenter \Delta$
\DisplayProof
\hfill
\Axiom$ \Gamma \fCenter \Delta$
\RightLabel{\RightR{\Weakening}}
\UnaryInf$ \Gamma \fCenter \Delta, !A$
\DisplayProof
\end{defish}

\subsection{Contraction}

\begin{defish}
\Axiom$ !A, !A, \Gamma \fCenter \Delta $
\RightLabel{\LeftR{\Contraction}}
\UnaryInf$ !A, \Gamma \fCenter \Delta$
\DisplayProof
\hfill
\Axiom$ \Gamma \fCenter \Delta, !A, !A$
\RightLabel{\RightR{\Contraction}}
\UnaryInf$ \Gamma \fCenter \Delta, !A$
\DisplayProof
\end{defish}

\subsection{Exchange}

\begin{defish}
\Axiom$ \Gamma, !A, !B, \Pi \fCenter \Delta $
\RightLabel{\LeftR{\Exchange}}
\UnaryInf$ \Gamma, !B, !A, \Pi \fCenter \Delta$
\DisplayProof
\hfill
\Axiom$ \Gamma \fCenter \Delta, !A, !B, \Lambda$
\RightLabel{\RightR{\Exchange}}
\UnaryInf$ \Gamma \fCenter \Delta, !B, !A, \Lambda$
\DisplayProof
\end{defish}

A series of weakening, contraction, and exchange inferences will often
be indicated by double inference lines.

The following rule, called ``cut,'' is not strictly speaking
necessary, but makes it a lot easier to reuse and combine derivations.
\begin{defish}
\[
\Axiom$ \Gamma \fCenter \Delta, !A$
\Axiom$ !A, \Pi \fCenter \Lambda $
\RightLabel{\Cut}
\BinaryInf$ \Gamma, \Pi \fCenter \Delta, \Lambda$
\DisplayProof
\]
\end{defish}
