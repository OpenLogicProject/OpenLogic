\begin{explain}
We've said what an assumption is, and we've given the rules of
inference.  !!^{derivation}s in the sequent calculus are inductively
generated from these: each !!{derivation} either is an assumption
on its own, or consists of one, two, or three !!{derivation}s followed
by a correct inference.
\end{explain}

\begin{defn}[!!^{derivation}]
A \emph{!!{derivation}} of !!a{sentence}~$!A$ from assumptions~$\Gamma$
is a tree of !!{sentence}s satisfying the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The topmost !!{sentence}s of the tree are either in $\Gamma$ or
  are !!{discharged} by an inference in the tree.
\item The bottommost !!{sentence} of the tree is~$!A$.
\item Every !!{sentence} in the tree except~$!A$ is a premise of a correct
  application of am inference rule whose conclusion stands directly
  below that !!{sentence} in the tree.
\end{enumerate}
We then say that $!A$ is the \emph{conclusion} of the
!!{derivation} and that $!A$ is \emph{!!{derivable}} from~$\Gamma$.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
Every assumption on its own is !!a{derivation}. So, e.g., $!C$ by
itself is !!a{derivation}, and so is $!D$ by itself.  We can obtain a
new !!{derivation} from these by applying, say, the $\Intro{\land}$
rule,
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$!A$}
\AxiomC{$!B$}
\RightLabel{\Intro{\land}}
\BinaryInfC{$!A \land !B$}
\end{prooftree}
These rules are meant to be general: we can replace the $!A$ and~$!B$
in it with any !!{sentence}s, e.g., by $!C$ and~$!D$. Then the
conclusion would be $!C \land !D$, and so
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$!C$}
\AxiomC{$!D$}
\RightLabel{\Intro{\land}}
\BinaryInfC{$!C \land !D$}
\end{prooftree}
is a correct !!{derivation}. Of course, we can also switch the
assumptions, so that $!D$ plays the role of~$!A$ and $!C$ that
of~$!B$. Thus,
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$!D$}
\AxiomC{$!C$}
\RightLabel{\Intro{\land}}
\BinaryInfC{$!D \land !C$}
\end{prooftree}
is also a correct derivation.

We can now apply another rule, say, $\Intro{\lif}$, which allows us to
conclude a conditional and allows us to !!{discharge} any assumption
that is identical to the conclusion of that conditional. So both of
the following would be correct !!{derivation}s:
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\Discharge{!C}{1}$}
\AxiomC{$!D$}
\RightLabel{\Intro{\land}}
\BinaryInfC{$!C \land !D$}
\DischargeRule{\Intro{\lif}}{1}
\UnaryInfC{$!C \lif (!C \land !D)$}
\DisplayProof
\AxiomC{$!C$}
\AxiomC{$\Discharge{!D}{1}$}
\RightLabel{\Intro{\land}}
\BinaryInfC{$!C \land !D$}
\DischargeRule{\Intro{\lif}}{1}
\UnaryInfC{$!D \lif (!C \land !D)$}
\end{prooftree}

\end{ex}
