\olsection{Lindenbaum's Lemma}

\begin{explain}
We now prove a lemma that shows that any consistent set of
!!{sentence}s is contained in some set of sentences which is not just
consistent, but also !!{complete}. The proof works by adding one
sentence at a time, guaranteeing at each step that the set remains
consistent. We do this so that for every $!A$, either $!A$ or $\lnot
!A$ gets added at some stage. The union of all stages in that
construction then contains either $!A$ or its negation~$\lnot !A$ and
is thus complete. It is also consistent, since we made sure at each
stage not to introduce an inconsistency.
\end{explain}

\begin{lem}[Lindenbaum's Lemma]
\ollabel{lem:lindenbaum} Every consistent set~$\Gamma'$ in a
language~$\Lang{L'}$ can be extended to a !!{complete} and consistent
set~$\Gamma^*$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\Gamma'$ be consistent.  Let $!A_0$, $!A_1$, \dots{}
be an enumeration of all the !!{formula}s of~$\Lang L'$.  Define
$\Gamma_0 = \Gamma'$, and
\[
\Gamma_{n+1} =
\begin{cases}
\Gamma_n \cup \{ !A_n \} & \textrm{if $\Gamma_n \cup \{!A_n\}$ is
  consistent;} \\
\Gamma_n \cup \{ \lnot !A_n \} & \textrm{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]
Let $\Gamma^* = \bigcup_{n \geq 0} \Gamma_n$.

Each $\Gamma_n$ is consistent: $\Gamma_0$ is consistent by definition.
If $\Gamma_{n+1} = \Gamma_n \cup \{!A_n\}$, this is because the latter
is consistent.  If it isn't, $\Gamma_{n+1} = \Gamma_n \cup \{\lnot
!A_n\}$. We have to verify that $\Gamma_n \cup \{\lnot !A_n\}$ is
consistent. Suppose it's not. Then \emph{both} $\Gamma_n \cup
\{!A_n\}$ and $\Gamma_n \cup \{\lnot !A_n\}$ are inconsistent.  This
means that $\Gamma_n$ would be inconsistent by
\tagrefs{prfSC/{fol:seq:prv:prop:explicit-inc},prfND/{fol:ntd:prv:prop:explicit-inc}},
contrary to the induction hypothesis.

Every finite subset of $\Gamma^*$ is a subset of~$\Gamma_n$ for
some~$n$, since each $!B \in \Gamma^*$ not already in~$\Gamma$ is
added at some stage~$i$. If $n$ is the last one of these, then all
$!B$ in the finite subset are in~$\Gamma_n$. So, every finite subset
of~$\Gamma^*$ is consistent. By
\tagrefs{prfSC/{fol:seq:ptn:prop:proves-compact},prfND/{fol:ntd:ptn:prop:proves-compact}},
$\Gamma^*$ is consistent.

Every !!{sentence} of $\Frm[L']$ appears on the list used to
define~$\Gamma^*$. If $!A_n \notin \Gamma^*$, then that is because
$\Gamma_n \cup \{!A_n\}$ was inconsistent.  But then $\lnot !A_n
\in \Gamma^*$, so $\Gamma^*$ is !!{complete}.
\end{proof}
