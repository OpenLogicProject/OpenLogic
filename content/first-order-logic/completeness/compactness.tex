\olsection{The Compactness Theorem}

\begin{defn}
  A set $\Gamma$ of !!{formula}s is \emph{finitely satisfiable} if and
  only if every finite $\Gamma_0 \subseteq \Gamma$ is satisfiable.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}[Compactness Theorem]
\ollabel{thm:compactness}
The following hold for any sentences $\Gamma$ and $!A$:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\Gamma \Entails !A$ iff there is a finite $\Gamma_0
    \subseteq \Gamma$ such that $\Gamma_0 \Entails !A$.
  \item $\Gamma$ is satisfiable if and only if it is finitely
    satisfiable.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We prove (2).  If $\Gamma$ is satisfiable, then there is a
!!{structure}~$\Struct{M}$ such that $\Sat{M}{!A}$ for all $!A \in
\Gamma$.  Of course, this $\Struct M$ also satisfies every finite
subset of~$\Gamma$, so $\Gamma$ is finitely satisfiable.

Now suppose that $\Gamma$ is finitely satisfiable.  Then every finite
subset~$\Gamma_0 \subseteq \Gamma$ is satisfiable.  By soundness,
every finite subset is consistent.  Then $\Gamma$ itself must be
consistent.  For assume it is not, i.e., $\Gamma \Proves \bot$.  But
!!{derivation}s are finite, and so already some finite
subset~$\Gamma_0 \subseteq \Gamma$ must be inconsistent
(cf.\ \tagrefs{prfSC/{fol:seq:ptn:prop:proves-compact},prfND/{fol:ntd:ptn:prop:proves-compact}}).
But we just showed they are all consistent, a contradiction.  Now by
completeness, since $\Gamma$ is consistent, it is satisfiable.
\end{proof}
