\olsection{Outline of the Proof}

The proof of the completeness theorem is a bit complex, and upon first
reading it, it is easy to get lost.  So let us outline the proof.  The
first step is a shift of perspective, that allows us to see a route to
a proof.  When completeness is thought of as ``whenever $\Gamma
\Entails !A$ then $\Gamma \Proves !A$,'' it may be hard to even come up
with an idea: for to show that $\Gamma \Proves !A$ we have to find a
!!{derivation}, and it does not look like the hypothesis that $\Gamma
\Entails !A$ helps us for this in any way.  For some proof systems it
is possible to directly construct a !!{derivation}, but we will take
a slightly different tack.  The shift in perspective required is this:
completeness can also be formulated as: ``if $\Gamma$ is consistent, it
has a model.''  Perhaps we can use the information in~$\Gamma$ together
with the hypothesis that it is consistent to construct a model.  After
all, we know what kind of model we are looking for: one that is as
$\Gamma$ describes it!

If $\Gamma$ contains only atomic sentences, it is easy
to construct a model for it: for atomic sentences are all of the form
$\Atom{P}{a_1,\dots,a_n}$ where the $a_i$ are !!{constant}s.  So all
we have to do is come up with a !!{domain}~$\Domain{M}$ and an
interpretation for $P$ so that
$\Sat{M}{\Atom{P}{a_1,\ldots,a_n}}$. But nothing's easier than that:
put $\Domain{M} = \Nat$, $\Assign{\Obj c_i}{M} = i$, and for every
$\Atom{P}{a_1,\ldots,a_n} \in \Gamma$, put the tuple $\tuple{k_1,
  \dots, k_n}$ into $\Assign{P}{M}$, where $k_i$ is the index of the
constant symbol~$a_i$ (i.e., $a_i \ident \Obj c_{k_i}$).

Now suppose $\Gamma$ contains some sentence $\lnot !B$, with $!B$
atomic.  We might worry that the construction of $\Struct M$
interferes with the possibility of making $\lnot !B$ true.  But here's
where the consistency of $\Gamma$ comes in: if $\lnot !B \in \Gamma$,
then $!B \notin \Gamma$, or else $\Gamma$ would be inconsistent.  And
if $!B \notin \Gamma$, then according to our construction of~$\Struct M$,
$\Sat/{M}{!B}$, so $\Sat{M}{\lnot !B}$.  So far so good.

Now what if $\Gamma$ contains complex, non-atomic formulas? Say, it
contains $!A \land !B$. Then we should proceed as if both $!A$ and $!B$ were
in $\Gamma$.  And if $!A \lor !B \in \Gamma$, then we will have to make at
least one of them true, i.e., proceed as if one of them was in~$\Gamma$.

This suggests the following idea: we add additional sentences to
$\Gamma$ so as to (a) keep the resulting set consistent and (b) make
sure that for every possible atomic sentence $!A$, either $!A$ is in
the resulting set, or $\lnot !A$, and (c) such that, whenever $!A
\land !B$ is in the set, so are both $!A$ and $!B$, if $!A \lor !B$ is
in the set, at least one of $!A$ or $!B$ is also, etc.  We keep doing
this (potentially forever).  Call the set of all sentences so
added~$\Gamma^*$.  Then our construction above would provide us with a
structure for which we could prove, by induction, that all sentences
in~$\Gamma^*$ are true in~$\Struct M$, and hence also all sentence
in~$\Gamma$ since $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma^*$.  It turns out that
guaranteeing (a) is enough. A set of sentences for which (a) holds is
called \emph{complete}. So our task will be to extend the consistent
set~$\Gamma$ to a consistent and complete set~$\Gamma^*$.

There is one wrinkle in this plan: if $\lexists[x][!A(x)] \in \Gamma$
we would hope to be able to pick some !!{constant}~$c$ and add $!A(c)$
in this process.  But how do we know we can always do that?  Perhaps we
only have a few !!{constant}s in our language, and for each one of
them we have $\lnot !B(c) \in \Gamma$.  We can't also add $!B(c)$,
since this would make the set inconsistent, and we wouldn't know
whether $\Struct{M}$ has to make $!B(c)$ or $\lnot !B(c)$ true.
Moreover, it might happen that $\Gamma$ contains only sentences in a
language that has no constant symbols at all (e.g., the language of
set theory).

The solution to this problem is to simply add infinitely many
constants at the beginning, plus sentences that connect them with the
quantifiers in the right way.  (Of course, we have to verify that this
cannot introduce an inconsistency.)

Our original construction works well if we only have !!{constant}s in
the atomic sentences.  But the language might also contain
!!{function}s.  In that case, it might be tricky to find the right
functions on~$\Nat$ to assign to these !!{function}s to make
everything work.  So here's another trick: instead of using $i$ to
interpret $\Obj c_i$, just take the set of !!{constant}s itself as the
domain.  Then $\Struct M$ can assign every !!{constant} to itself:
$\Assign{\Obj c_i}{M} = \Obj c_i$.  But why not go all the way: let
$\Domain{M}$ be all \emph{terms} of the language!{} If we do this,
there is an obvious assignment of functions (that take terms as
arguments and have terms as values) to !!{function}s: we assign to the
!!{function}~$\Obj f^n_i$ the function which, given $n$ terms $t_1$,
\dots,~$t_n$ as input, produces the term $\Obj f^n_i(t_1, \dots, t_n)$
as value.

The last piece of the puzzle is what to do with~$\eq$.  The
!!{predicate}~$\eq$ has a fixed interpretation: $\Sat{M}{\eq[t][t']}$
iff $\Value{t}{M} = \Value{t'}{M}$.  Now if we set things up so that the
!!{value} of a term~$t$ is $t$ itself, then this !!{structure}
will make \emph{no} sentence of the form $\eq[t][t']$ true
unless $t$ and $t'$ are one and the same term.  And of
course this is a problem, since basically every interesting theory in
a language with !!{function}s will have as theorems sentences
$\eq[t][t']$ where $t$ and $t'$ are not the same term (e.g., in
theories of arithmetic: $\eq[(\Obj 0+ \Obj 0)][\Obj 0]$).  To solve
this problem, we change the domain of~$\Struct M$: instead of using terms as
the objects in~$\Domain{M}$, we use sets of terms, and each set is so
that it contains all those terms which the sentences in~$\Gamma$
require to be equal.  So, e.g., if $\Gamma$ is a theory of arithmetic,
one of these sets will contain: $\Obj 0$, $(\Obj 0 + \Obj 0)$, $(\Obj
0 \times \Obj 0)$, etc.  This will be the set we assign to $\Obj 0$,
and it will turn out that this set is also the value of all the terms
in it, e.g., also of $(\Obj 0 + \Obj 0)$.  Therefore, the sentence
$\eq[(\Obj 0+ \Obj 0)][\Obj 0]$ will be true in this revised
!!{structure}.

So here's what we'll do. First we investigate the properties of
!!{complete} consistent sets, in particular we prove that
!!a{complete} consistent set contains $!A \land !B$ iff it contains
both $!A$ and~$!B$, $!A \lor !B$ iff it contains at least one of them,
etc. (\olref[ccs]{prop:ccs}). Then we define and investigate
``saturated'' sets of sentences. A saturated set is one which contains
conditionals that link each quantified !!{sentence} to instances of it
(\olref[hen]{defn:henkin-exp}). We show that any consistent
set~$\Gamma$ can always be extended to a saturated set~$\Gamma'$
(\olref[hen]{lem:henkin}). If a set is consistent, saturated, and
!!{complete} it also has the property that it contains
\iftag{prvEx}{$\lexists[x][!A(x)]$ iff it contains $!A(t)$ for some
  closed term~$t$}{}\iftag{defEx,defAll}{}{ and
}\iftag{prvAll}{$\lforall[x][!A(x)]$ iff it contains $!A(t)$ for all
  closed terms~$t$}{} (\olref[hen]{prop:saturated-instances}).  We'll
then take the saturated consistent set~$\Gamma'$ and show that it can
be extended to a saturated, consistent, and !!{complete}
set~$\Gamma^*$ (\olref[lin]{lem:lindenbaum}). This set $\Gamma^*$ is
what we'll use to define our term model~$\Struct{M(\Gamma^*)}$.  The
term model has the set of closed terms as its domain, and the
interpretation of its !!{predicate}s is given by the atomic
!!{sentence}s in~$\Gamma^*$ (\olref[mod]{defn:termmodel}).  We'll use
the properties of consistent, complete, saturated sets to show that
indeed $\Sat{M(\Gamma^*)}{!A}$ iff $!A \in \Gamma^*$
(\olref[mod]{lem:truth}), and thus in particular,
$\Sat{M(\Gamma^*)}{\Gamma}$.  Finally, we'll consider how to define a
term model if $\Gamma$ contains~$\eq$ as well
(\olref[ide]{defn:term-model-factor}) and show that it
satisfies~$\Gamma^*$ (\olref[ide]{lem:truth}).
