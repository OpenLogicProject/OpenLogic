\part{First-order Logic}

\begin{editorial}
  This part covers the metatheory of first-order logic through
  completeness.  Currently it does not rely on a separate treatment of
  propositional logic.  It is planned, however, to separate the
  propositional and quantifier material on semantics and proof theory
  so that propositional logic can be covered independently.  This will
  become important especially when material on propositional modal
  logic will be added, since then one might \emph{not} want to cover
  quantifiers.  Currently four different proof systems are offered as
  alternatives, sequent calculus, natural deduction, signed tableaux,
  and axiomatic proofs. This part still needs an introduction
  (\gitissue{69}).
