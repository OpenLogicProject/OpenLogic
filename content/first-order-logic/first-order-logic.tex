\olpart{fol}{First-order Logic}

\begin{editorial}
  This part covers the metatheory of first-order logic through
  completeness.  Currently it does not rely on a separate treatment of
  propositional logic; everything is proved.  The source files will
  exclude the material on quantifiers (and replace ``!!{structure}''
  with ``!!{valuation}'', $\Struct{M}$ with $\pAssign{v}$, etc.) if
  the ``FOL'' tag is false. In fact, most of the material in the part
  on propositional logic is simply the first-order material with the
  ``FOL'' tag turned off.

  If the part on propositional logic is included, this results in a
  lot of repetition. It is planned, however, to make it possible to
  let this part take into account the material on propositional logic
  (and exclude the material already covered, as well as shorten proofs
  with references to the respective places in the propositional
  part).

  Currently four different proof systems are offered as
  alternatives, sequent calculus, natural deduction, signed tableaux,
  and axiomatic proofs. This part still needs an introduction
  (\gitissue{69}).
