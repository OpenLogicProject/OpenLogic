\olchapter{fol}{byd}{Beyond First-order Logic}

\begin{editorial}
  This chapter, adapted from Jeremy Avigad's logic notes, gives the
  briefest of glimpses into which other logical systems there are. It
  is intended as a chapter suggesting further topics for study in a
  course that does not cover them.  Each one of the topics mentioned
  here will---hopefully---eventually receive its own part-level
  treatment in the Open Logic Project.
