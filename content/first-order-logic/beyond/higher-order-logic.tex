\olsection{Higher-Order logic}

Passing from first-order logic to second-order logic enabled us to
talk about sets of objects in the first-order !!{domain}, within the
formal language. Why stop there? For example, third-order logic should
enable us to deal with sets of sets of objects, or perhaps even sets
which contain both objects and sets of objects. And fourth-order logic
will let us talk about sets of objects of that kind. As you may have
guessed, one can iterate this idea arbitrarily.

In practice, higher-order logic is often !!{formula}ted in terms of
functions instead of relations. (Modulo the natural identifications,
this difference is inessential.) Given some basic ``sorts'' $A$, $B$,
$C$,~\dots (which we will now call ``types''), we can create new ones
by stipulating
\begin{quote}
If $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are finite types then so is $\sigma \to \tau$.
\end{quote}
Think of types as syntactic ``labels,'' which classify the objects we
want in our !!{domain}; $\sigma \to \tau$ describes those objects that
are functions which take objects of type~$\sigma$ to objects of
type~$\tau$. For example, we might want to have a type $\Omega$ of
truth values, ``true'' and ``false,'' and a type $\Nat$ of natural
numbers. In that case, you can think of objects of type $\Nat \to
\Omega$ as unary relations, or subsets of $\Nat$; objects of type
$\Nat \to \Nat$ are functions from natural numers to natural numbers;
and objects of type $(\Nat \to \Nat) \to \Nat$ are ``functionals,''
that is, higher-type functions that take functions to numbers.

As in the case of second-order logic, one can think of higher-order
logic as a kind of many-sorted logic, where there is a sort for each
type of object we want to consider. But it is usually clearer just to
define the syntax of higher-type logic from the ground up. For
example, we can define a set of finite types inductively, as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Nat$ is a finite type.
\item If $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are finite types, then so is $\sigma
  \to \tau$.
\item If $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are finite types, so is $\sigma \times
  \tau$.
\end{enumerate}
Intuitively, $\Nat$ denotes the type of the natural numbers,
$\sigma \to \tau$ denotes the type of functions from $\sigma$ to
$\tau$, and $\sigma \times \tau$ denotes the type of pairs of objects,
one from $\sigma$ and one from $\tau$. We can then define a set of
terms inductively, as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each type $\sigma$, there is a stock of variables $x$, $y$,
  $z$, \dots of type $\sigma$
\item $\Obj 0$ is a term of type $\Nat$
\item $\Obj S$ (successor) is a term of type $\Nat \to \Nat$
\item If $s$ is a term of type $\sigma$, and $t$ is a term of type
  $\Nat \to (\sigma \to \sigma)$, then $\Obj{R}_{st}$ is a term of type
  $\Nat \to \sigma$
\item If $s$ is a term of type $\tau \to \sigma$ and $t$ is a
  term of type~$\tau$, then $s(t)$ is a term of type $\sigma$
\item If $s$ is a term of type~$\sigma$ and $x$ is a variable of
  type~$\tau$, then $\lambd[x][s]$ is a term of type $\tau \to \sigma$.
\item If $s$ is a term of type~$\sigma$ and $t$ is a term of
  type~$\tau$, then $\tuple{s, t}$ is a term of type $\sigma \times
  \tau$.
\item If $s$ is a term of type~$\sigma \times \tau$ then $p_1(s)$ is a
  term of type~$\sigma$ and $p_2(s)$ is a term of type~$\tau$.
\end{enumerate}
Intuitively, $\Obj{R}_{st}$ denotes the function defined recursively by
\begin{align*}
\Obj{R}_{st}(0) & = s \\
\Obj{R}_{st}(x+1) & = t(x, R_{st}(x)),
\end{align*}
$\tuple{s, t}$ denotes the pair whose first component is~$s$ and whose
second component is~$t$, and $p_1(s)$ and~$p_2(s)$ denote the first
and second elements (``projections'') of~$s$. Finally, $\lambd[x][s]$
denotes the function~$f$ defined by
\[
f(x) = s
\]
for any~$x$ of type~$\sigma$; so item (6) gives us a form of
comprehension, enabling us to define functions using
terms. !!^{formula}s are built up from !!{identity} statements $\eq[s][t]$
between terms of the same type, the usual propositional connectives,
and higher-type quantification. One can then take the axioms of the
system to be the basic equations governing the terms defined above,
together with the usual rules of logic with quantifiers and !!{identity}.

If one augments the finite type system with a type $\Omega$ of truth
values, one has to include axioms which govern its use as well. In
fact, if one is clever, one can get rid of complex !!{formula}s
entirely, replacing them with terms of type $\Omega$!{} The proof
system can then be modified accordingly. The result is essentially the
\emph{simple theory of types} set forth by Alonzo Church in the 1930s.

As in the case of second-order logic, there are different versions of
higher-type semantics that one might want to use. In the full version,
variables of type $\sigma \to \tau$ range over the set of \emph{all}
functions from the objects of type~$\sigma$ to objects of type~$\tau$.
As you might expect, this semantics is too strong to admit a complete,
effective proof system. But one can consider a weaker semantics, in
which a !!{structure} consists of sets of elements $T_\tau$ for each
type $\tau$, together with appropriate operations for application,
projection, etc. If the details are carried out correctly, one can
obtain completeness theorems for the kinds of proof systems described
above.

Higher-type logic is attractive because it provides a framework in
which we can embed a good deal of mathematics in a natural way:
starting with $\Nat$, one can define real numbers, continuous
functions, and so on. It is also particularly attractive in the
context of intuitionistic logic, since the types have clear
``constructive'' intepretations. In fact, one can develop constructive
versions of higher-type semantics (based on intuitionistic, rather
than classical logic) that clarify these constructive interpretations
quite nicely, and are, in many ways, more interesting than the
classical counterparts.
