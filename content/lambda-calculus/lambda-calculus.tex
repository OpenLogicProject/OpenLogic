\olpart{lam}{The Lambda Calculus}

\begin{editorial}
This part deals with the lambda calculus. The introduction chapter is
based on Jeremy Avigad's notes; part of it is now redundant and covered in
later chapters. The chapters on syntax, Church-Rosser property, and
lambda definability were produced by Zesen Qian during his Mitacs summer
internship. They still have to be reviewed and revised.
