\olsection{The \usetoken{S}{lambda definable} Functions are Closed under Composition}

\begin{lem}
The !!{lambda definable} functions are closed under composition.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $f$ is defined by composition from $h$, $g_0,$
\dots,~$g_{k-1}$. Assuming $h$, $g_0$, \dots,~$g_{k-1}$ are
!!{lambda defined} by $H$, $G_0$, \dots,~$G_{k-1}$,
respectively, we need to find a term~$F$ that !!{lambda define}s~$f$. But we
can simply define~$F$ by
\[
F(x_0, \dots, x_{l-1}) = H(G_0(x_0, \dots, x_{l-1}),
\dots, G_{k-1}(x_0, \dots, x_{l-1})).
\]
In other words, the language of the lambda calculus is well suited to
represent composition.
\end{proof}
