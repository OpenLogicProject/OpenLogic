\olsection{The \usetoken{S}{lambda definable} Functions are Closed under Minimization}

\begin{lem}
Suppose $f(x,y)$ is primitive recursive. Let $g$ be defined by
\[
g(x) \simeq \umin{y}{f(x,y)}.
\]
Then $g$ is !!{lambda definable}.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
The idea is roughly as follows. Given $x$, we will use the fixed-point
lambda term $Y$ to define a function $h_x(n)$ which searches for a~$y$
starting at~$n$; then $g(x)$ is just $h_x(0)$. The function~$h_x$ can
be expressed as the solution of a fixed-point equation:
\[
h_x(n) \simeq
\begin{cases}
n & \text{if $f(x,n) = 0$} \\
h_x(n+1) & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]

Here are the details. Since $f$ is primitive recursive, it is
!!{lambda defined} by some term $F$. Remember that we also have a lambda
term~$D$, such that $D(M, N, \bar{0}) \red M$ and $D(M, N, \bar{1})
\red N$. Fixing $x$ for the moment, to !!{lambda define} $h_x$ we want to
find a term~$H$ (depending on~$x$) satisfying
\[
H(\num{n}) \equiv D(\num{n}, H(S(\num{n})), F(x, \num{n})).
\]
We can do this using the fixed-point term~$Y$. First, let $U$ be the
term
\[
\lambd[h][\lambd[z][D(z,(h(Sz)),F(x,z))]],
\]
and then let $H$ be the term~$YU$. Notice that the only free variable
in~$H$ is~$x$. Let us show that $H$ satisfies the equation above.

By the definition of $Y$, we have
\[
H = YU \equiv U(YU) = U(H).
\]
In particular, for each natural number~$n$, we have
\begin{align*}
H(\num{n}) & \equiv U(H, \num{n}) \\
& \red D(\num{n}, H(S(\num{n})), F(x, \num{n})),
\end{align*}
as required. Notice that if you substitute a numeral $\num{m}$ for~$x$
in the last line, the expression reduces to $\num{n}$ if $F(\num{m},
\num{n})$ reduces to $\num{0}$, and it reduces to $H(S(\num{n}))$ if
$F(\num{m}, \num{n})$ reduces to any other numeral.

To finish off the proof, let $G$ be $\lambd[x][H(\num 0)]$. Then $G$
!!{lambda define}s $g$; in other words, for every $m$, $G(\num m)$ reduces to
reduces to $\overline {g(m)}$, if $g(m)$ is defined, and has no
normal form otherwise.
\end{proof}
