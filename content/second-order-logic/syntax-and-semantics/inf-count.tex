\olsection{Describing Infinite and \usetoken{S}{enumerable}
  \usetoken{P}{domain}}

A set~$M$ is (Dedekind) infinite iff there is !!a{injective} function~$f\colon M
\to M$ which is not !!{surjective}, i.e., with $\dom{f} \neq M$. In
first-order logic, we can consider a one-place !!{function}~$f$ and
say that the function~$\Assign{f}{M}$ assigned to it in
!!a{structure}~$\Struct{M}$ is !!{injective} and $\ran{f} \neq
\Domain{M}$:
\[
\lforall[x][\lforall[y][(\eq[f(x)][f(y)] \to \eq[x][y])]] \land
\lexists[y][\lforall[x][\eq/[y][f(x)]]]
\]
If $\Struct{M}$ satisfies this !!{sentence}, $\Assign{f}{M}:
\Domain{M} \to \Domain{M}$ is !!{injective}, and so $\Domain{M}$ must
be infinite. If $\Domain{M}$ is infinite, and hence such a function
exists, we can let $\Assign{f}{M}$ be that function and $\Struct{M}$
will satisfy the sentence.  However, this requires that our language
contains the non-logical symbol~$f$ we use for this purpose. In
second-order logic, we can simply say that such a function
\emph{exists}. This no-longer requires~$f$, and we have the
!!{sentence} in pure second-order logic
\[
\fn{Inf} \ident \lexists[u][(\lforall[x][\lforall[y][(\eq[u(x)][u(y)]
      \lif \eq[x][y])]] \land \lexists[y][\lforall[x][\eq/[y][u(x)]]])]
\]
$\Sat{M}{\fn{Inf}}$ iff $\Domain{M}$ is infinite.  We can then define
$\fn{Fin} \ident \lnot \fn{Inf}$; $\Sat{M}{\fn{Fin}}$ iff $\Domain{M}$
is finite. No single !!{sentence} of pure first-order logic can
express that the !!{domain} is infinite although an infinite set of
them can. There is no set of !!{sentence}s of pure first-order logic
that is satisfied in !!a{structure} iff its domain is finite.

\begin{prop}
$\Sat{M}{\fn{Inf}}$ iff $\Domain{M}$ is infinite.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
$\Sat{M}{\fn{Inf}}$ iff
  $\Sat{M}{\lforall[x][\lforall[y][(\eq[u(x)][u(y)] \lif \eq[x][y])]]
    \land \lexists[y][\lforall[x][\eq/[y][u(x)]]]}[s]$ for
  some~$s$. If it does, $s(u)$ is !!a{injective} function, and some $y
  \in \Domain{M}$ is not in the domain of~$s(u)$. Conversely, if there
  is !!a{injective} $f\colon \Domain{M} \to \Domain{M}$ with $\dom{f}
  \neq \Domain{M}$, then $s(u) = f$ is such a variable
  assignment.
\end{proof}

A set $M$ is !!{enumerable} if there is an enumeration
\[
m_0, m_1, m_2, \dots
\]
of its !!{element}s (without repetitions).  Such an enumeration exists
iff there is !!a{element} $z \in M$ and a function $f\colon M \to M$
such that $z$, $f(z)$, $f(f(z))$ are all the !!{element}s of~$M$. For
if the enumeration exists, $z = m_0$ and $f(m_k) = m_{k+1}$ (or
$f(m_k) = m_k$ if $m_k$ is the last !!{element} of the enumeration)
are the requisite !!{element} and function. On the other hand, if such
a $z$ and $f$ exist, then $z$, $f(z)$, $f(f(z))$, \dots, is an
enumeration of~$M$, and $M$ is !!{enumerable}.  We can express the
existence of $z$ and $f$ in second-order logic to produce a
!!{sentence} true in !!a{structure} iff the structure is
!!{enumerable}:
\[
\fn{Count} \ident
\lexists[z][\lexists[u][\lforall[X][((X(z) \land
      \lforall[x][(X(x) \lif X(u(x)))]) \lif \lforall[x][X(x)])]]]
\]

\begin{prop}
$\Sat{M}{\fn{Count}}$ iff $\Domain{M}$ is !!{enumerable}.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $\Domain{M}$ is enumerable, and let $m_0$, $m_1$, \dots, be an
enumeration. By removing repetions we can guarantee that no $m_k$
appears twice. Define $f(m_k) = m_{k+1}$ and let $s(z) = m_0$ and
$s(u) = f$. We show that
\[
\Sat{M}{\lforall[X][((X(z) \land \lforall[x][(X(x) \lif X(u(x)))])
    \lif \lforall[x][X(x)])]}[s]
\]
Suppose $s' \sim_X s$, and $M = s'(X)$. Suppose further that
$\Sat{M}{(X(z) \land \lforall[x][(X(x) \lif X(u(x)))])}[s']$. Then
$s'(z) \in M$ and whenever $x \in M$, also $s'(u)(x) \in M$. In other
words, since $s' \sim_X s$, $m_0 \in M$ and if $x \in M$ then $f(x)
\in M$, so $m_0 \in M$, $m_1 = f(m_0) \in M$, $m_2 = f(f(m_0)) \in M$,
etc. Thus, $M = \Domain{M}$, and
$\Sat{M}{\lforall[x][X(x)]}{s'}$. Since $s'$ was an arbitrary
$X$-variant of~$s$, we are done.

Now assume that
\[
\Sat{M}{\lforall[X][((X(z) \land \lforall[x][(X(x) \lif X(u(x)))])
    \lif \lforall[x][X(x)])]}[s]
\]
for some~$s$. Let $m = s(z)$ and $f = s(u)$ and consider $M = \{m,
f(m), f(f(m)), \dots\}$. Let $s'$ be the $X$-variant of $s$ with $s(X)
= M$. Then
\[
\Sat{M}{((X(z) \land \lforall[x][(X(x) \lif X(u(x)))])
    \lif \lforall[x][X(x)])}[s']
\]
by assumption. Also, $\Sat{M}{X(z)}[s']$ since $s'(X) = M \ni m =
s'(z)$, and also $\Sat{M}{\lforall[x][(X(x) \lif X(u(x)))]}[s']$ since
whenever $x \in M$ also $f(x) \in M$. So, since both antecedent and
conditional are satisfied, the consequent must also be:
$\Sat{M}{\lforall[x][X(x)]}[s']$. But that means that $M =
\Domain{M}$, and so $\Domain{M}$ is !!{enumerable}.
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
The sentence $\fn{Inf} \land \fn{Count}$ is true in all and only
!!{denumerable} domains.  Adjust the definition of $\fn{Count}$ so
that it becomes a different !!{sentence} that directly expresses that
the domain is !!{denumerable}, and prove that it does.
\end{prob}
