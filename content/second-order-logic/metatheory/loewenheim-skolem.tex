\olsection{The L\"owenheim-Skolem Theorem Fails for Second-order Logic}

\begin{explain}
The (Downward) L\"owenheim-Skolem Theorem states that every set of
!!{sentence}s with an infinite model has !!a{enumerable} model.  It,
too, is a consequence of the completeneness theorem: the proof of
completeness generates a model for any consistent set of
!!{sentence}s, and that model is !!{enumerable}.  There is also an
Upward L\"owenheim-Skolem Theorem, which guarantees that if a set of
!!{sentence}s has !!a{denumerable} model it also has
!!a{nonenumerable} model.  Both theorems fail in second-order logic.
\end{explain}


\begin{thm}
\ollabel{thm:sol-no-ls} The L\"owenheim-Skolem Theorem fails for
second-order logic: There are !!{sentence}s with infinite models but
no !!{enumerable} models.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Recall that 
\[
\fn{Count} \ident \lexists[z][\lexists[u][\lforall[X][((X(z) \land
      \lforall[x][(X(x) \lif X(u(x)))]) \lif \lforall[x][X(x)])]]]
\]
is true in !!a{structure}~$\Struct{M}$ iff $\Domain{M}$ is
!!{enumerable}, so $\lnot\fn{Count}$ is true in~$\Struct{M}$
iff $\Domain{M}$ is !!{nonenumerable}.  There are
such !!{structure}s---take any !!{nonenumerable} set as the
!!{domain}, e.g., $\Pow{\Nat}$ or~$\Real$. So $\lnot \fn{Count}$ 
has infinite models but no !!{enumerable} models.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
There are !!{sentence}s with !!{denumerable} but no
!!{nonenumerable} models.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
$\fn{Count} \land \fn{Inf}$ is true in $\Nat$ but not in any
  !!{structure}~$\Struct{M}$ with $\Domain{M}$ !!{nonenumerable}.
\end{proof}
