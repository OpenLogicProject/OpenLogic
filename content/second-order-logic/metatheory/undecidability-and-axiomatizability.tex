\olsection{Second-order Logic is not Axiomatizable}


\begin{thm}
\ollabel{thm:sol-undecidable}
Second-order logic is undecidable.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
A first-order !!{sentence} is valid in first-order logic iff it is
valid in second-order logic, and first-order logic is undecidable.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
\ollabel{cor:sol-not-axiomatizable}
There is no sound and complete !!{derivation} system for second-order logic.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $!A$ be !!a{sentence} in the language of arithmetic.  $\Sat{N}{!A}$
iff $\Th{PA^2} \Entails !A$. Let $!P$ be the conjunction of the nine
axioms of~$\Th{PA^2}$. $\Th{PA^2} \Entails !A$ iff $\Entails !P \lif
!A$, i.e., $\Sat{M}{!P \lif !A$}. Now consider the !!{sentence}
$\lforall[z][\lforall[u][\lforall[u'][\lforall[u''][\lforall[L][(!P' \lif !A')]]]]]$ resulting by
replacing $\Obj{0}$ by $z$, $\prime$ by the one-place function
variable $u$, $+$ and $\times$ by the two-place function-variables 
$u'$ and  $u''$, respectively,
and $<$ by the two-place relation variable~$L$ and
universally quantifying.  It is a valid sentence of pure second-order
logic iff the original sentence was valid iff $\Th{PA^2} \Entails !A$
iff $\Sat{N}{!A}$.  Thus if there were a sound and complete proof
system for second-order logic, we could use it to define a computable
enumeration $f\colon \Nat \to \Sent[L_A]$ of the !!{sentence}s true
in~$\Struct{N}$. This function would be representable in~$\Th{Q}$ by
some first-order formula~$!B_f(x, y)$. Then the
!!{formula}~$\lexists[x][!B_f(x, y)]$ would define the set of true
first-order !!{sentence}s of~$\Struct{N}$, contradicting Tarski's
Theorem.
\end{proof}
