\olsection{Second-order Logic is not Compact}

\begin{explain}
Call a set of sentences~$\Gamma$ \emph{finitely satisfiable} if every
one of its finite subsets is satisfiable.  First-order logic has the
property that if a set of !!{sentence}s~$\Gamma$ is finitely
satisfiable, it is satisfiable.  This property is called
\emph{compactness}.  It has an equivalent version involving
entailment: if $\Gamma \Entails !A$, then already $\Gamma_0 \Entails
!A$ for some finite subset~$\Gamma_0 \subseteq \Gamma$. In this
version it is an immediate corollary of the completeness theorem: for
if $\Gamma \Entails !A$, by completeness $\Gamma \Proves !A$. But a
!!{derivation} can only make use of finitely many !!{sentence}s
of~$\Gamma$.

Compactness is not true for second-order logic. There are sets of
second-order !!{sentence}s that are finitely satisfiable but not
satisfiable, and that entail some~$!A$ without a finite subset
entailing~$!A$.

\begin{thm}
\ollabel{thm:sol-undecidable}
Second-order logic is not compact.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Recall that 
\[
\fn{Inf} \ident \lexists[u][(\lforall[x][\lforall[y][(\eq[u(x)][u(y)]
      \lif \eq[x][y])]] \land \lexists[y][\lforall[x][\eq/[y][u(x)]]])]
\]
is satisfied in !!a{structure} iff its domain is infinite. Let
$!A^{\ge n}$ be a sentence that asserts that the domain has at least
$n$ !!{element}s, e.g.,
\[
!A^{\ge n} \ident \lexists[x_1][\dots\lexists[x_n][(\eq/[x_1][x_2]
    \land \eq/[x_1][x_3] \land \dots \land \eq/[x_{n-1}][x_n])]].
\]
Consider the set of !!{sentence}s
\[
\Gamma = \{\lnot \fn{Inf}, !A^{\ge 1}, !A^{\ge 2}, !A^{\ge 3}, \dots\}.
\]
It is finitely satisfiable, since for any finite subset~$\Gamma_0
\subseteq \Gamma$
there is some $k$ so that $!A^{\ge k} \in \Gamma$ but no $!A^{\ge n}
\in \Gamma$ for $n>k$. If $\Domain{M}$ has $k$ !!{element}s,
$\Sat{M}{\Gamma_0}$. But, $\Gamma$ is not satisfiable: if
$\Sat{M}{\lnot \fn{Inf}}$, $\Domain{M}$ must be finite, say, of
size~$k$. Then $\Sat/{M}{!A^{\ge k+1}}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
Give an example of a set~$\Gamma$ and !!a{sentence}~$!A$ so that
$\Gamma \Entails !A$ but for every finite subset~$\Gamma_0 \subseteq
\Gamma$, $\Gamma_0 \Entails/ !A$.
\end{prob}
