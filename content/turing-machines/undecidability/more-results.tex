\olsection{More Results}

\begin{explain}
We have already shown that first-order logic is undecidable. In this section we will prove two corollaries:

\emph{Corollary:} First-order logic without identity is not decidable.

and

\emph{Corollary:} First-order logic without identity and terms is not decidable.

We will proceed in five parts. First, we know that
if first-order-logic with identity and terms ($\Lang{L_T}$) is decidable,
then the halting problem is solvable (i.e., we reduce the halting problem to the
decision problem). We then show that for any sentence $!A$ of $L_T$,
$\Sat{}{\lforall[x]\lexists[y][\Atom{R}{x}{y}]\lif !A'}$ if, and only if,
$\Sat{}{!A}$. From these two things, it follows that if first-order
logic with identity ($\Lang{L_=}$) is decidable, then the halting problem
 is also solvable. 
 
 We then prove that for any sentence $!A$ of $\Lang{L_=} , 
\Sat{}{(!E \land !D) \lif !A(=/!E)}$. Finally, we can then show that if firtr-order
logic without identity and terms is decidable, then the halting problem is 
solvable.
