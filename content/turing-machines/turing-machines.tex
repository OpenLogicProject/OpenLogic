\olpart{tur}{Turing Machines}

\begin{editorial}
The material in this part is a basic and informal introduction to
Turing machines. It needs more examples and exercises, and perhaps
information on available Turing machine simulators. The proof of the
unsolvability of the decision problem uses a successor function, hence
all models are infinite.  One could strengthen the result by using a
successor relation instead. There probably are subtle oversights; use
these as checks on students' attention (but also file issues!).
