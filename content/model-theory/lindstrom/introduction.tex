\section{Introduction}

In this chapter we aim to prove Lindstr\"om's characterization of
first-order logic as the maximal logic for which (given certain
further constraints) the Compactness and the Downward
L\"owenheim-Skolem theorems hold
(\olref[fol][com][com]{thm:compactness} and
\olref[fol][com][dls]{thm:downward-ls}). First, we need a more general
characterization of the general class of logics to which the theorem
applies. We will restrict ourselves to \emph{relational} languages,
i.e., languages which only contain !!{predicate}s and individual
constants, but no !!{function}s.
