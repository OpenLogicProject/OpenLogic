\olpart{mod}{Model Theory}

\begin{editorial}
  Material on model theory is incomplete and experimental.  It is
  currently simply an adaptation of Aldo Antonelli's notes on model
  theory, less those topics covered in the part on first-order logic
  (theories, completeness, compactness).  It requires much more
  introduction, motivation, and explanation, as well as exercises, to
  be useful for a textbook.  Andy Arana is at planning to work on this
  part specifically (\gitissue{65}).
