\olsection{Overspill}

\begin{thm}
\ollabel{overspill} If a set $\Gamma$ of sentences has arbitrarily
large finite models, then it has an infinite model.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Expand the language of $\Gamma$ by adding countably many new constants
$c_0$, $c_1$, \dots and consider the set $\Gamma \cup \{c_i \neq c_j :
i \neq j\}$. To say that $\Gamma$ has arbitrarily large finite models
means that for every $m >0$ there is $n\ge m$ such that $\Gamma$ has a
model of cardinality~$n$. This implies that $\Gamma \cup \{c_i \neq
c_j : i \neq j\}$ is finitely satisfiable. By compactness, $\Gamma
\cup \{c_i \neq c_j : i \neq j\}$ has a model $\Struct M$ whose domain
must be infinite, since it satisfies all inequalities $c_i \neq c_j$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\ollabel{inf-not-fo} 
There is no sentence $!A$ of any first-order language that is true in
a !!{structure} $\Struct M$ if and only if the domain $\Domain{M}$ of
the !!{structure} is infinite.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
If there were such a $!A$, its negation $\lnot !A$ would be true in
all and only the finite !!{structure}s, and it would therefore have
arbitrarily large finite models but it would lack an infinite model,
contradicting \olref{overspill}.
\end{proof}
