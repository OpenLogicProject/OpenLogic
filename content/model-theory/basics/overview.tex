\olsection{Overview}

\epigraph{Logic appears in a \textit{“sacred”} and in a \textit{“profane”} form;
the sacred form is dominant in proof theory, the profane form in model theory}
{\textit{Dirk van Dalen}}

Model theory applies logic to the study of mathematical structures.
While model theory has existed since the 20th century, the name was first
coined by Alfred Tarski, a member of the Lwów–Warsaw school, in 1954.
