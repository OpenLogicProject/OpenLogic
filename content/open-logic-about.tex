The \textit{Open Logic Text} is an open-source, collaborative textbook
of formal meta-logic and formal methods, starting at an intermediate level
(i.e., after an introductory formal logic course). Though aimed at a
non-mathematical audience (in particular, students of philosophy and
computer science), it is rigorous.

Coverage of some topics currently included may
not yet be complete, and many sections still require substantial
revision. We plan to expand the text to cover more topics in
the future. We also plan to add features to the text, such as a
glossary, a list of further reading, historical notes, pictures, better
explanations, sections explaining the relevance of results to
philosophy, computer science, and mathematics, and more problems and
examples. If you find an error, or have a suggestion,
\href{https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic/wiki/Contributing}{please let the project team know}.

The project operates in the spirit of open source. Not only is the
text freely available, we provide the LaTeX source under the
Creative Commons Attribution license, which gives anyone the right to
download, use, modify, re-arrange, convert, and re-distribute our
work, as long as they give appropriate credit.
