\olsection{Equinumerous Sets}

\begin{intro}
We have an intuitive notion of ``size'' of sets, which works fine for
finite sets. But what about infinite sets? If we want to come up with
a formal way of comparing the sizes of two sets of \emph{any} size, it
is a good idea to start with defining when sets are the same size.
Let's say sets of the same size are \emph{equinumerous}. We want the
formal notion of equinumerosity to correspond with our intuitive
notion of ``same size,'' hence the formal notion ought to satisfy the
following properties:

\begin{description}
\item[Reflexivity:] Every set is equinumerous with itself.
\item[Symmetry:] For any sets $X$ and $Y$, if $X$ is equinumerous with
  $Y$, then $Y$ is equinumerous with $X$.
\item[Transitivity:] For any sets $X, Y$, and $Z$, if $X$ is
  equinumerous with $Y$ and $Y$ is equinumerous with $Z$, then $X$ is
  equinumerous with $Z$.
\end{description}

In other words, we want equinumerosity to be an
\emph{equivalence relation}.
\end{intro}

\begin{defn}
A set $X$ is \emph{equinumerous} with a set $Y$, $\cardeq{X}{Y}$, if
and only if there is !!a{bijective} $f \colon X \to Y$.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
Equinumerosity defines an equivalence relation.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} Let $X, Y$, and $Z$ be sets.

\begin{description}

\item[Reflexivity:] Using the identity map $1_X \colon X \to X$, where
  $1_X (x) = x$ for all $x \in X$, we see that $X$ is equinumerous
  with itself (clearly, $1_X$ is !!{bijective}).

\item[Symmetry:] Suppose that $X$ is equinumerous with~$Y$. Then there
  is !!a{bijective} $f\colon X \rightarrow Y$. Since $f$ is
  !!{bijective}, its inverse $f^{-1}$ exists and also
  !!{bijective}. Hence, $f^{-1}\colon Y \to X$ is a !!{bijective}
  function from $Y$ to~$X$, so $Y$ is also equinumerous with~$X$.

\item[Transitivity:] Suppose that $X$ is equinumerous with $Y$ via the
  !!{bijective} function~$f\colon X \to Y$ and that $Y$ is
  equinumerous with $Z$ via the !!{bijective} function~$g\colon Y \to
  Z$. Then the composition of $\comp{f}{g}\colon X \to Z$ is
  !!{bijective}, and $X$ is thus equinumerous with~$Z$.
\end{description}
Therefore, equinumerosity is an equivalence relation.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are equinumerous. Then $X$ is !!{enumerable} if
and only if $Y$ is.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be equinumerous.  Suppose that $X$ is
!!{enumerable}. Then either $X = \emptyset$ or there is
!!a{surjective} function $f\colon \Int^+ \to X$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are
equinumerous, there is !!a{bijective} $g\colon X \to Y$. If $X =
\emptyset$, then $Y = \emptyset$ also (otherwise there would be
!!a{element}~$y \in Y$ but no $x \in X$ with $g(x) = y$).  If, on the
other hand, $f\colon \Int^+ \to X$ is !!{surjective}, then
$\comp{f}{g} \colon \Int^+ \to Y$ is !!{surjective}. To see this, let
$y \in Y$. Since $g$ is !!{surjective}, there is an $x \in X$ such
that $g(x) = y$. Since $f$ is !!{surjective}, there is an $n \in \Int^+$
such that $f(n) = x$. Hence,
\[
(\comp{f}{g})(n) = g(f(n)) = g(x) = y
\]
and thus $\comp{f}{g}$ is !!{surjective}. We have that $\comp{f}{g}$
is an enumeration of~$Y$, and so $Y$~is !!{enumerable}.
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
Show that if $X$ is equinumerous with $U$ and and $Y$ is equinumerous
with $V$, and the intersections $X \cap Y$ and $U \cap V$ are empty,
then the unions $X \cup Y$ and $U \cup V$ are equinumerous.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Show that if $X$ is infinite and !!{enumerable}, then it is
equinumerous with the positive integers~$\Int^+$.
\end{prob}
