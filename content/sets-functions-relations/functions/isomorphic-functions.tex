\olsection{Isomorphism}

\begin{explain}
An \emph{isomorphism} is a bijection that preserves the structure of
the sets it relates, where structure is a matter of the relationships
that obtain between the !!{element}s of the sets. Consider the
following two sets $X=\{1,2,3\}$ and $Y=\{4,5,6\}$. These sets are
both structured by the relations successor, less than, and greater
than. An isomorphism between the two sets is !!a{bijection} that
preserves those structures. So a !!{bijective} function $f \colon X
\to Y$ is an isomorphism if, $i<j$ iff $f(i)<f(j)$, $i>j$ iff
$f(i)>f(j)$, and $j$ is the successor of $i$ iff $f(j)$ is the
successor of $f(i)$.
\end{explain}

\begin{defn}[Isomorphism]
Let $U$ be the pair $\langle X, R\rangle$ and $V$ be the pair $\langle
Y, S\rangle$ such that $X$ and $Y$ are sets and $R$ and $S$ are
relations on $X$ and $Y$ respectively. A !!{bijection} $f$ from $X$ to
$Y$ is an \emph{isomorphism} from $U$ to $V$ iff it preserves the
relational structure, that is, for any $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ in $X$,
$\tuple{x_1,x_2} \in R$ iff $\tuple{f(x_1),f(x_2)} \in S$.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
Consider the following two sets $X=\{1,2,3\}$ and $Y=\{4,5,6\}$, and
the relations less than and greater than. The function $f\colon X \to
Y$ where $f(x) = 7-x$ is an isomorphism between $\tuple{X,<}$ and
$\tuple{Y,>}$.
