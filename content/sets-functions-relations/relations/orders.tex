\begin{defn}[Preorder]
A relation which is both reflexive and transitive is called a
\emph{preorder.}  
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Partial order]
A preorder which is also anti-symmetric is called a
\emph{partial order}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Total order]
 A partial order which is also connected is called a
\emph{total order} or \emph{linear order.} (If we want to emphasize
that the order is reflexive, we add the adjective ``weak''---see
below).
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
Every linear order is also a partial order, and every partial order is
also a preorder, but the converses don't hold. For instance, the
identity relation and the full relation on~$X$ are preorders, but they
are not partial orders, because they are not anti-symmetric (if $X$
has more than one element). For a somewhat less silly example,
consider the \emph{no longer than} relation $\preccurlyeq$
on~$\Bin^*$: $x \preccurlyeq y$ iff $\len{x} \le \len{y}$. This is a
preorder, even a linear preorder, but not a partial order.

The relation of \emph{divisibility without remainder} gives us an
example of a partial order which isn't a linear order: for integers
$n$, $m$, we say $n$ (evenly) divides $m$, in symbols: $n\mid m$, if
there is some $k$ so that $m=kn$. On $\Nat$, this is a partial order,
but not a linear order: for instance, $2\nmid3$ and also
$3\nmid2$. Considered as a relation on $\Int$, divisibility is only a
preorder since anti-symmetry fails: $1\mid-1$ and $-1\mid1$ but
$1\neq-1$. Another important partial order is the relation $\subseteq$
on a set of sets.

Notice that the examples $L$ and $G$ from \olref[set]{relations},
although we said there that they were called ``strict orders'' are not
linear orders even though they are connected (they are not
reflexive). But there is a close connection, as we will see
momentarily.
\end{ex}

\begin{defn}[Irreflexivity]
A relation $R$ on $X$ is called \emph{irreflexive} if, for all $x \in
X$, $ \lnot Rxx$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Asymmetry]
A relation $R$ on $X$ is called \emph{asymmetric} if for no pair $x,y\in
X$ we have $Rxy$ and $Ryx$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Strict partial order]
A \emph{strict partial order} is a relation which is irreflexive, 
asymmetric, and transitive. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Strict linear order]
A strict partial order which is also connected is called a \emph{strict linear
  order.}
\end{defn}

A strict partial order on~$X$ can be turned into a weak partial order
by adding the diagonal $\Id{X}$, i.e., adding all the pairs~$\tuple{x,
  x}$.  (This is called the \emph{reflexive closure} of~$R$.)
Conversely, starting from a weak partial order, one can get a strict
partial order by removing~$\Id{X}$.

\begin{prop}
  \ollabel{strict-weak}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $R$ is a strict partial (linear) order on~$X$, then $R^+ = R
    \cup \Id{X}$ is a weak partial (linear) order.
  \item If $R$ is a weak partial (linear) order on~$X$, then $R^- = R
    \setminus \Id{X}$ is a strict partial (linear) order.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose $R$ is a strict partial order, i.e., $R \subseteq
      X^2$ and $R$ is irreflexive, asymmetric, and transitive. Let $R^+
      = R \cup \Id{X}$. We have to show that $R^+$ is reflexive,
      antisymmetric, and transitive.

      $R^+$ is clearly reflexive, since for all $x \in X$, $\tuple{x,
        x} \in \Id{X} \subseteq R^+$.

      To show $R^+$ is antisymmetric, suppose $R^+xy$ and $R^+yx$,
      i.e., $\tuple{x,y}$ and $\tuple{y, x} \in R^+$, and $x \neq y$.
      Since $\tuple{x,y} \in R \cup \Id{X}$, but $\tuple{x, y} \notin
      \Id{X}$, we must have $\tuple{x, y} \in R$, i.e.,
      $Rxy$. Similarly we get that~$Ryx$. But this contradicts the
      assumption that $R$ is asymmetric.

      Now suppose that $R^+xy$ and $R^+yz$. If both $\tuple{x, y} \in
      R$ and $\tuple{y,z} \in R$, it follows that $\tuple{x, z} \in R$
      since $R$~is transitive. Otherwise, either $\tuple{x, y} \in
      \Id{X}$, i.e., $x = y$, or $\tuple{y, z} \in \Id{X}$, i.e., $y =
      z$. In the first case, we have that $R^+yz$ by assumption, $x =
      y$, hence $R^+xz$. Similarly in the second case. In either case, $R^+xz$,
      thus, $R^+$ is also transitive.

      If $R$ is linear, then for all $x \neq y$, either $Rxy$
      or~$Ryx$, i.e., either $\tuple{x, y} \in R$ or $\tuple{y, x} \in
      R$. Since $R \subseteq R^+$, this remains true of $R^+$, so
      $R^+$ is linear as well.
    \item Exercise.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
  Complete the proof of \olref[sfr][rel][ord]{strict-weak}, i.e.,
  prove that if $R$ is a weak partial order on~$X$, then $R^- =
  R \setminus \Id{X}$ is a strict partial order. 
\end{prob}


\begin{ex}
$\le$ is the weak linear order corresponding to the strict linear
  order~$<$. $\subseteq$ is the weak partial order corresponding to the
  strict partial order~$\subsetneq$.
