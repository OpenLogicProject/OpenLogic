\part{Sets, Relations, Functions}

\begin{editorial}
  The material in this part is a reasonably complete introduction to
  basic naive set theory.  Unless students can be assumed to have this
  background, it's probably advisable to start a course with a review
  of this material, at least the part on sets, functions, and
  relations.  This should ensure that all students have the basic
  facility with mathematical notation required for any of the other
  logical sections.  NB: This part does not cover induction directly.

  The presentation here would benefit from additional examples,
  especially, ``real life'' examples of relations of interest to the
  audience.

  It is planned to expand this part to cover naive set theory more
  extensively.
