\olsection{The Reals as Cauchy Sequences}

In \olref[cuts]{sec}, we constructed the reals as Dedekind cuts. In
this section, we explain an alternative construction. It builds on
Cauchy's definition of (what we now call) a Cauchy sequence; but the
use of this definition to \emph{construct} the reals is due to other
nineteenth-century authors, notably Weierstrass, Heine, M\'{e}ray and
Cantor. (For a nice history, see \citeauthor{OConnorRobertson:RN}
\citeyear{OConnorRobertson:RN}.)

Before we get to the nineteenth century, it's worth considering Simon
Stevin (1548--1620). In brief, Stevin realised that we can think of
each real in terms of its decimal expansion. Thus even an irrational
number, like $\sqrt{2}$, has a nice decimal expansion, beginning:
\[
	1.41421356237\ldots
\] 
It is very easy to model decimal expansions in set theory: simply
consider them as functions $d \colon \Nat \to \Nat$, where $d(n)$ is
the $n$th decimal place that we are interested in. We will then need a
bit of tweak, to handle the bit of the real number that comes before
the decimal point (here, just $1$). We will also need a further tweak
(an equivalence relation) to guarantee that, for example, $0.999\ldots
= 1$. But it is not difficult to offer a perfectly rigorous
construction of the real numbers, in the manner of Stevin, within set
theory. 

Stevin is not our focus. (For more on Stevin, see
\citealt{KatzKatz2012}.) But here is a closely related thought.
Instead of treating $\sqrt{2}$'s decimal expansion directly, we can
instead consider a  \emph{sequence} of increasingly accurate rational
approximations to $\sqrt{2}$, by considering the increasingly precise
expansions: 
\[
1, 1.4, 1.414, 1.4142, 1.41421,\ldots
\]
The idea that reals can be considered via ``increasingly good
approximations'' provides us with the basis for another sequence of
insights (akin to the realisations that we used when constructing
$\Rat$ from $\Int$, or $\Int$ from $\Nat$). The basic insights are
these:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Every real can be written as a (perhaps infinite) decimal
	expansion.
	\item The information encoded by a (perhaps infinite) decimal
	expansion can be equally be encoded by a sequence of rational
	numbers.
	\item A sequence of rational numbers can be thought of as a
	function from $\Nat$ to $\Rat$; just let $f(n)$ be the $n$th
	rational in the sequence.
\end{enumerate}
Of course, not just \emph{any} function from $\Nat$ to $\Rat$ will
give us a real number. For instance, consider this function:
\[
	f(n) =\begin{cases}
			1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd}\\
			0 &\text{if }n\text{ is even}
		\end{cases}
\]
Essentially the worry here is that the sequence $0,1,0,1,0,1,0,\ldots$
doesn't seem to ``hone in'' on any real. So: to ensure that we
consider sequences which do hone in on some real, we need to restrict
our attention to sequences which have some \emph{limit}. 

We have already encountered the idea of a limit, in
\olref[his][set][limits]{sec}. But we cannot use \emph{quite} the same
definition as we used there. The expression ``$(\forall \epsilon>0)$''
there tacitly involved quantification over the real numbers; and we
were considering the limits of functions on the real numbers; so
invoking that definition would be to help ourselves to the real
numbers; and they are exactly what we were aiming to \emph{construct}.
Fortunately, we can work with a closely related idea of a limit. 
\begin{defn}\ollabel{def:CauchySequence}
  A function $f: \Nat \to \Rat$ is a \emph{Cauchy sequence} iff for
  any positive $\epsilon \in \Rat$ we have that $(\exists \ell \in
  \Nat)(\forall m, n > \ell)|f(m) - f(n)| < \epsilon$.
\end{defn}

The general idea of a limit is the same as before: if you want a
certain level of precision (measured by~$\epsilon$), there is a
``region'' to look in (any input greater than~$\ell$). And it is easy
to see that our sequence $1$, $1.4$, $1.414$, $1.4142$,
$1.41421$\ldots has a limit: if you want to approximate $\sqrt{2}$ to
within an error of $\nicefrac{1}{10^{n}}$, then just look to any entry
after the $n$th.

The obvious thought, then, would be to say that a real number just
\emph{is} any Cauchy sequence. But, as in the constructions of $\Int$
and $\Rat$, this would be too na\"{i}ve: for any given real number,
multiple different Cauchy sequences indicate that real number. A
simple way to see this as follows. Given a Cauchy sequence~$f$, define
$g$ to be exactly the same function as~$f$, except that $g(0)\neq
f(0)$. Since the two sequences agree everywhere after the first
number, we will (ultimately) want to say that they have the same
limit, in the sense employed in \olref{def:CauchySequence},
and so should be thought of ``defining'' the same real. So, we should
really think of these Cauchy sequences as the same real number.

Consequently, we again need to define an equivalence relation on the
Cauchy sequences, and identify real numbers with equivalence
relations. First we need the idea of a function which tends to $0$ in
the limit. For any function $h : \Nat \to \Rat$, say that \emph{$h$
tends to $0$} iff for any positive $\epsilon \in \Rat$ we have that
$(\exists \ell \in \Nat)(\forall n > \ell)|f(n)| <
\epsilon$.\footnote{Compare this with the definition of $\lim_{x
\mathord{\rightarrow}\infty}f(x) = 0$ in
\olref[his][set][limits]{sec}.} Further, where $f$ and $g$ are
functions $\Nat \to \Rat$, let $(f-g)(n) = f(n) - g(n)$. Now define:
\[
	f \Realequiv g \text{ iff $(f-g)$ tends to $0$}.
\]
We need to check that $\Realequiv$ is an equivalence relation; and it
is. We can then, if we like, define the reals as the equivalence
classes, under $\Realequiv$, of all Cauchy sequences from $\Nat \to
\Rat$.

\begin{prob}
Let $f(n) = 0$ for every $n$. Let $g(n) = \frac{1}{(n+1)^2}$. Show
that both are Cauchy sequences, and indeed that the limit of both
functions is $0$, so that also $f \sim_\Real g$. 
\end{prob}

Having done this, we shall as usual write $\equivrep{f}{\Realequiv}$
for the equivalence class with $f$ as !!a{element}. However, to keep
things readable, in what follows we will drop the subscript and write
just $\equivrep{f}{}$. We also stipulate that, for each $q \in \Rat$,
we have $q_{\Real} = \equivrep{c_{q}}{}$, where $c_{q}$ is the
constant function $c_q(n) = q$ for all $n \in \Nat$. We then define
basic relations and operations on the reals, e.g.:
\begin{align*}
	\equivrep{f}{} + \equivrep{g}{} &= 	\equivrep{(f + g)}{} \\
	\equivrep{f}{} \times 	\equivrep{g}{} &= \equivrep{(f \times g)}{} 
\end{align*}
where $(f + g)(n) = f(n) + g(n)$ and $(f \times g)(n) = f(n) \times
g(n)$. Of course, we also need to check that each of  $(f + g)$,
$(f-g)$ and $(f\times g)$ are Cauchy sequences when $f$ and $g$ are;
but they are, and we leave this to you.

Finally, we define we a notion of order. Say $\equivrep{f}{}$ is
\emph{positive} iff both $\equivrep{f}{}\neq 0_\Rat$ and $(\exists
\ell \in \Nat)(\forall n > \ell)0 < f(n)$. Then say $\equivrep{f}{} <
\equivrep{g}{}$ iff $\equivrep{(g - f)}{}$ is positive. We have to
check that this is well-defined (i.e., that it does not depend upon
choice of ``representative'' function from the equivalence class). 
%\begin{align*}
%	\equivrep{f}{} \leq \equivrep{g}{} \text{ iff }&\equivrep{f}{} = \equivrep{g}{} \text{ or }\\
%	&(\exists \ell \in \Nat)(\forall n \in \Nat)(\ell < n \lif f(n) \leq g(n))
%\end{align*}
But having done this, it is quite easy to show that these yield the
right algebraic properties; that is:
\begin{thm}\ollabel{thm:cauchyorderedfield}
The Cauchy sequences constitute an \emph{ordered field}.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Exercise. 
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
Prove that the Cauchy sequences constitute an ordered field.
\end{prob}

It is harder to prove that the reals, so constructed, have the
Completeness Property, so we will give the proof.

\begin{thm}
Every non-empty set of Cauchy sequences with an upper bound has a
least upper bound.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch] Let $S$ be any non-empty set of Cauchy
sequences with an upper bound. So there is some $p \in \Rat$ such that
$p_{\Real}$ is an upper bound for $S$. Let $r \in S$; then there is
some $q \in \Rat$ such that $q_{\Real} < r$. So if a least upper bound
on $S$ exists, it is between $q_\Real$ and $p_\Real$ (inclusive). 

We will hone in on the l.u.b., by approaching it simultaneously from
below and above. In particular, we define two functions, $f, g \colon
\Nat \to \Rat$, with the aim that $f$ will hone in on the l.u.b.\ from
above, and $g$ will hone on in it from below. We start by defining:
\begin{align*}
	f(0) &= p \\
	g(0) &= q
\end{align*}
Then, where $a_n = \frac{f(n) + g(n)}{2}$, let:\footnote{This is a
recursive definition. But we have not \emph{yet} given any reason to
think that recursive definitions are ok.}
\begin{align*}
	f(n+1) &=
	\begin{cases}
		a_n &\text{if $(a_n)_\Real$ is an upper bound for }S\\
		f(n)&\text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}\\
	g(n+1) &=
	\begin{cases}
		a_n &\text{if $(a_n)_\Real$ is a lower bound for }S\\
	 	g(n) &\text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{align*}
Both $f$ and $g$ are Cauchy sequences. (This can be checked fairly
easily; but we leave it as an exercise.) Note that the function $(f-g)$
tends to $0$, since the difference between $f$ and $g$ halves at every
step. Hence $\equivrep{f}{} = \equivrep{g}{}$. 

To show that  $\equivrep{f}{}$ is an upper bound for $S$, we will
invoke \olref{thm:cauchyorderedfield}. Let $\equivrep{h}{} \in S$ and
suppose, for reductio, that $\equivrep{f}{} < \equivrep{h}{}$, so that
$0_\Real < \equivrep{(h-f)}{}$. Since $f$ is a monotonically
decreasing Cauchy sequence, there is some $k \in \Nat$ such that
$\equivrep{(c_{f(k)} - f)}{} < \equivrep{(h-f)}{}$. So:
\[
(f(k))_\Real  = \equivrep{c_{f(k)}}{} < \equivrep{f}{} + \equivrep{(h-f)}{} = \equivrep{h}{},
\]
contradicting the fact that $(f(k)_\Real)$ is, by construction, an
upper bound for $S$.

In an exactly similar way, we can show that $\equivrep{g}{}$ is a
lower bound for $S$. So $\equivrep{f}{} = \equivrep{g}{}$ is the
\emph{least} upper bound for $S$.
\end{proof}
