\section{Other Resources}

There are many books on how to do proofs in mathematics which may be
useful. Check out \emph{How to Read and do Proofs: An Introduction to
Mathematical Thought Processes} \citep{Solow2013} and \emph{How to
Prove It: A Structured Approach} \citep{Velleman2019} in particular.
The
\href{http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/BookOfProof.pdf}{\emph{Book
of Proof}} \citep{Hammack2013} and
\href{https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/books/7/}{\emph{Mathematical
Reasoning}} \citep{Sandstrum2019} are books on proof that are freely
available online.  Philosophers might find
\emph{More
Precisely: The Math you need to do Philosophy} \citep{Steinhart2018} to
be a good primer on mathematical reasoning. 

There are also various shorter guides to proofs available on the
internet; e.g.,
\href{https://math.berkeley.edu/~hutching/teach/proofs.pdf}{``Introduction
  to Mathematical Arguments''} \citep{Hutchings2003} and
\href{http://http://eugeniacheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cheng-proofguide.pdf}{``How to
  write proofs''} \citep{Cheng2004}.
