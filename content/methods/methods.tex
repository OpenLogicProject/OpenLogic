\part{Methods}

\begin{editorial}
  This part covers general and methodological material, especially
  explanations of various proof methods a non-metahmatics student may
  be unfamiliar with. It currently contains a chapter on induction,
  but chapters on how to write proofs in general, and on mathematical
  terminology, are also planned.
