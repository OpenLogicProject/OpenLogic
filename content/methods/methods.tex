\part{Methods}

\begin{editorial}
  This part covers general and methodological material, especially
  explanations of various proof methods a non-methematics student may
  be unfamiliar with. It currently contains a chapter on how to write
  proofs, and a chapter on induction, but additional sections for
  thos, exercises, and a chapter on mathematical terminology is also
  planned.
