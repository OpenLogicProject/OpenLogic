\olchapter{int}{pty}{Propositions as Types}

\begin{editorial}
  This is a \emph{very experimental} draft of a chapter on the
  Curry-Howard correspondence.  It needs more explanation and
  motivation, and there are probably errors and omissions. The proof
  of normalization should be reviewed and expanded. There are no
  examples for the product type. Permuation and simplification
  conversions are not covered. It will make a lot more sense once
  there is also material on the (typed) lambda calculus which is
  basically presupposed here. Use with extreme caution.
