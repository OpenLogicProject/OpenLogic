\olsection{Decidability}
Observe that the proof of the completeness theorem gives us for every
$\Gamma \Proves/ !A$ a model with an infinite number of worlds
witnessing the fact that $\Gamma \Entails/ !A$. The following
proposition shows that to prove $\Entails !A$ it is enough to prove
that $\mSat{M}{!A}$ for all finite models (i.e., models with a finite
set of worlds).

\begin{thm}\ollabel{thm:decidability}
  If $\Entails/ !A$ then there is a finite model $\mSat/{M'}{!A}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Assume $\mModel{M}=\tuple{W, R, V}$ is such that $\mSat/{M}{!A}$ and $P$ 
  is the set of !!{propositional variable}s occurring in~$!A$. Define
  $\mModel{M'}=\tuple{W', R', V'}$ by letting $W' = \Setabs{[w]}{w \in W}$ 
  where $[w] = \Setabs{p \in P}{w \in V(p)}$, $R'$ be the subset relation, 
  and $V'(p)=\Setabs{[w]}{p \in [w]}$. It should be clear that $W'$ is a 
  finite set and that $\mModel{M'}$ is !!a{relational model}.

  It can be shown, by induction on~$!A$, that 
  \[
    \mSat{M}{!A}[w] \text{ iff } \mSat{M'}{!A}[{[w]}]
  \]
  for all !!{formula}s $!A$ with only !!{propositional variable}s
  from~$P$. This is left as an exercise for the reader.
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
Finish the proof of \olref[int][sc][dec]{thm:decidability} by showing
that $\mSat{M,w}{!A}$ iff $\mSat{M',[w]}{!A}$ for all !!{formula}s~$!A$
with only propositional variables from~$P$. 
\end{prob}

From \olref{thm:decidability} it follows that there is an algorithm to
decide whether~$\Entails !A$.
