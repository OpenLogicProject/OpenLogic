\olpart{pl}{Propositional Logic}

\begin{editorial}
  This part contains material on classical propositional logic. The
  first chapter is relatively rudimenatry and just lists definitions
  and results, many proofs are not carried out but are left as
  exercises. The material on proof systems and the completeness
  theorem is included from the part on first-order logic, with the
  ``FOL'' tag set to false. This leaves out everything related to
  predicates, terms, and quantifiers, and replaces talk of
  !!{structure}s~$\Struct{M}$ with talk about
  !!{valuation}s~$\pAssign{v}$.

  It is planned to expand this part to include
  more detail, and to add further topics and results, such as
  truth-functional completeness.
