\olsection{The Normal Form Theorem}

\begin{thm}[Kleene's Normal Form Theorem]
\ollabel{thm:kleene-nf}
There is a primitive recursive relation $T(e, x, s)$ and a primitive
recursive function $U(s)$, with the following property: if $f$ is any
partial recursive function, then for some~$e$,
\[
f(x) \simeq U(\umin{s}{T(e, x, s)})
\]
for every $x$.
\end{thm}

\begin{explain}
The proof of the normal form theorem is involved, but the basic idea
is simple.  Every partial recursive function has an \emph{index}~$e$,
intuitively, a number coding its program or definition.  If $f(x)
\defined$, the computation can be recorded systematically and coded by
some number~$s$, and that $s$ codes the computation of $f$ on input
$x$ can be checked primitive recursively using only $x$ and the
definition~$e$.  This means that $T$ is primitive recursive.  Given
the full record of the computation~$s$, the ``upshot'' of~$s$ is the
value of~$f(x)$, and it can be obtained from~$s$ primitive recursively
as well.

The normal form theorem shows that only a single unbounded search is
required for the definition of any partial recursive function.  We can
use the numbers $e$ as ``names'' of partial recursive functions, and
write $\cfind{e}$ for the function $f$ defined by the equation in the
theorem.  Note that any partial recursive function can have more than
one index---in fact, every partial recursive function has infinitely
many indices.
