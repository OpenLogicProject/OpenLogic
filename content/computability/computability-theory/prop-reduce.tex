\olsection{Properties of Reducibility}

We write $A \leq_m B$ if $A$ reduces to~$B$, and this notation
suggests that if $A \leq_m B$, then $A$ is ``no harder than''~$B$ and
that $B$ is ``as hard or harder than''~$A$, and that $\le_m$, like the
usual $\le$ on numbers, orders sets (or decision problems) by their
complexity. The following two propositions support this intuition. The
first one say taht $\le_m$ is transitive.

\begin{prop}
\ollabel{prop:trans-red}
If $A \leq_m B$ and $B \leq_m C$, then $A \leq_m C$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Composing a reduction of $A$ to~$B$ with a reduction of $B$ to
$C$ yields a reduction of $A$ to~$C$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
Prove \olref{prop:trans-red} by showing that if $f$ and~$g$ are
many-one reductions of $A$ to~$B$ and $B$ to~$C$, respectively, then
$\comp{f}{g}$ is a many-one reduction of $A$ to~$C$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prop}
\ollabel{prop:reduce}
Let $A$ and $B$ be any sets, and suppose $A \leq_m B$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $B$ is computably enumerable, so is~$A$.
\item If $B$ is computable, so is~$A$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let $f$ be a many-one reduction from $A$ to~$B$. For the first
claim, just check that if $B$ is the domain of a partial function~$g$,
then $A$ is the domain of~$\comp{f}{g}$:
\begin{align*}
x \in A & \text{ iff } f(x) \in B \\
& \text{ iff }  g(f(x)) \fdefined.
\end{align*}

For the second claim, remember that if $B$~is computable then $B$
and~$\Complement{B}$ are computably enumerable
(\olref[cmp]{thm:ce-comp}). It is not hard to check that $f$~is also a
many-one reduction of $\Complement{A}$ to $\Complement{B}$, so, by the
first part of this proof, $A$ and~$\Complement{A}$ are !!{computably
enumerable}. So $A$ is computable as well by \olref[cmp]{thm:ce-comp}.
(Alternatively, you can check that $\Char{A} = \comp{f}{\Char{B}}$; so
if $\Char{B}$ is computable, then so is~$\Char{A}$.)
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
Suppose $f$ is a many-one reduction of $A$ to~$B$. Show that $f$ is
also a many-one reduction of $\Complement{A}$ to $\Complement{B}$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Show that if $f\colon A \to B$ is a many-one reduction, then $\Char{A}
= \comp{f}{\Char{B}}$.
\end{prob}

\begin{digress}
A more general notion of reducibility called \emph{Turing
reducibility} is useful in other contexts, especially for proving
undecidability results. Note that by \olref[cmp]{cor:comp-k}, the
complement of~$K_0$ is not reducible to~$K_0$, since it is not
computably enumerable. But, intuitively, if you knew the answers to
questions about $K_0$, you would know the answer to questions about
its complement as well. A set $A$ is said to be Turing reducible
to~$B$ if one can determine answers to questions in~$A$ using a
computable procedure that can ask questions about~$B$. This is more
liberal than many-one reducibility, in which (1)~you are only allowed
to ask one question about $B$, and (2)~a ``yes'' answer has to
translate to a ``yes'' answer to the question about $A$, and similarly
for ``no.'' It is still the case that if $A$~is Turing reducible
to~$B$ and $B$~is computable then $A$~is computable as well (though,
as we have seen, the analogous statement does not hold for computable
enumerability).

You should think about the various notions of reducibility we have
discussed, and understand the distinctions between them. We will,
however, only deal with many-one reducibility in this chapter.
Incidentally, both types of reducibility discussed in the last
paragraph have analogues in computational complexity, with the added
requirement that the Turing machines run in polynomial time: the
complexity version of many-one reducibility is known as \emph{Karp
reducibility}, while the complexity version of Turing reducibility is
known as \emph{Cook reducibility}.
