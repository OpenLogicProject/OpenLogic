\olsection{There Are Non-Computable Sets}


We saw above that every computable set is computably enumerable. Is
the converse true? The following shows that, in general, it is not.

\begin{thm}
Let $K_0$ be the set $\Setabs{\tuple{e, x}}{\cfind{e}(x) \fdefined}$.
Then $K_0$ is computably enumerable but not computable.
\end{them}

\begin{proof}
To see that $K_0$ is computably enumerable, note that it is the
domain of the function~$f$ defined by
\[
f(z) = \umin{y}{(\len{z} = 2 \land T((z)_0, (z)_1, y))}.
\]
For, if $\cfind{e}(x)$ is defined, $f(\tuple{e, x})$ finds a halting
computation sequence; if $\cfind{e}(x)$ is undefined, so is
$f(\tuple{e, x})$; and if $z$ doesn't even code a pair, then $f(z)$ is
also undefined.

The fact that $K_0$ is not computable is just the undecidability of
the halting problem, \olref[hlt]{thm:halting-thm}.
\end{proof}
