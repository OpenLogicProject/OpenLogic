\olsection{Lambda Representable Functions Closed under Composition}

\begin{lem}
The lambda representable functions are closed under composition.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $f$ is defined by composition from $h$, $g_0,$
\dots,~$g_{k-1}$. Assuming $h$, $g_0$, \dots,~$g_{k-1}$ are
represented by $\num{h}$, $\num{g_0}$, \dots,~$\num{g_{k-1}}$,
respectively, we need to find a term~$\num f$ representing~$f$. But we
can simply define~$\num{f}$ by
\[
\num{f}(x_0, \dots, x_{l-1}) = \num{h}(\num{g_0}(x_0, \dots, x_{l-1}),
\dots, \num{g_{k-1}}(x_0, \dots, x_{l-1})).
\]
In other words, the language of the lambda calculus is well suited to
represent composition.
\end{proof}
