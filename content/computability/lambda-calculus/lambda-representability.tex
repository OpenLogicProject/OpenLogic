\olsection{Representability by Lambda Terms}

How can the lambda calculus serve as a model of computation? At first,
it is not even clear how to make sense of this statement. To talk
about computability on the natural numbers, we need to find a suitable
representation for such numbers. Here is one that works surprisingly
well.

\begin{defn}
For each natural number~$n$, define the \emph{numeral} $\num{n}$ to be
the lambda term $\lambd[x][\lambd[y][(x(x(x(\dots x(y)))))]]$, where
there are $n$ $x$'s in all.
\end{defn}

The terms $\num{n}$ are ``iterators'': on input $f$, $\num{n}$ returns
the function mapping $y$ to $f^n(y)$. Note that each numeral is
normal. We can now say what it means for a lambda term to ``compute''
a function on the natural numbers.

\begin{defn}
Let $f(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$ be an $n$-ary partial function from $\Nat$
to $\Nat$. We say a lambda term $X$ \emph{represents} $f$ if for every
sequence of natural numbers $m_0$, \dots,~$m_{n-1}$,
\[
X \num{m_0} \num{m_1} \dots \num{m_{n-1}} \red \num{f(m_0, m_1, \dots,
  m_{n-1})}
\]
if $f(m_0, \dots, m_{n-1})$ is defined, and $X \num{m_0} \num{m_1}
\dots \num{m_{n-1}}$ has no normal form otherwise.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
\ollabel{thm:lambda-rep}
A function $f$ is a partial computable function if and only if it is
represented by a lambda term.
\end{thm}

\begin{explain}
This theorem is somewhat striking. As a model of computation, the
lambda calculus is a rather simple calculus; the only operations are
lambda abstraction and application!{} From these meager resources,
however, it is possible to implement any computational procedure.
\end{explain}
